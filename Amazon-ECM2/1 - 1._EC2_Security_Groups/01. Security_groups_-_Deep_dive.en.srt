00:00:00.03 --> 00:00:02.07
- [Instructor] Welcome
back, in this video,

2
00:00:02.07 --> 00:00:05.06
we're gonna talk about security groups.

3
00:00:05.06 --> 00:00:08.05
If you're ready, let's begin.

4
00:00:08.05 --> 00:00:11.05
All right, so what is a security group?

5
00:00:11.05 --> 00:00:14.04
A security group acts
as a virtual firewall

6
00:00:14.04 --> 00:00:19.08
that controls the traffic for
one or more EC2 instances.

7
00:00:19.08 --> 00:00:22.09
When you launch an
instance you associate one

8
00:00:22.09 --> 00:00:26.06
or more security groups
with that instance.

9
00:00:26.06 --> 00:00:30.03
So it is not that we can only
associate one security group

10
00:00:30.03 --> 00:00:34.04
per instance, we could associate
multiple security groups

11
00:00:34.04 --> 00:00:36.07
per EC2 instance.

12
00:00:36.07 --> 00:00:38.08
We add rules to each security group

13
00:00:38.08 --> 00:00:45.00
that allow traffic to, or
from, its associated instances.

14
00:00:45.00 --> 00:00:49.02
We can modify the rules of a
security group at any time,

15
00:00:49.02 --> 00:00:51.06
and the new rules are
automatically applied

16
00:00:51.06 --> 00:00:54.01
to all instances that are associated

17
00:00:54.01 --> 00:00:56.04
with the security group.

18
00:00:56.04 --> 00:00:59.01
In the next video, when
we'll be doing a hands-on

19
00:00:59.01 --> 00:01:02.04
on security groups, we'll
see this live in action.

20
00:01:02.04 --> 00:01:04.04
We will modify the security group

21
00:01:04.04 --> 00:01:06.09
and we'll notice that
as soon as you modify,

22
00:01:06.09 --> 00:01:10.03
the changes are applied immediately.

23
00:01:10.03 --> 00:01:13.00
Every security group
can have different set

24
00:01:13.00 --> 00:01:18.06
of rules for inbound,
and outbound traffic.

25
00:01:18.06 --> 00:01:24.00
By default security groups
allow all outbound traffic.

26
00:01:24.00 --> 00:01:27.08
When we create a security
group, it has no inbound rules,

27
00:01:27.08 --> 00:01:30.09
therefore, no inbound traffic originating

28
00:01:30.09 --> 00:01:35.02
from another host to your
EC2 instance is allowed,

29
00:01:35.02 --> 00:01:40.04
until you add inbound rules
to the security group.

30
00:01:40.04 --> 00:01:43.08
So, by default, everything
is allowed outbound,

31
00:01:43.08 --> 00:01:46.09
nothing is allowed inbound.

32
00:01:46.09 --> 00:01:50.00
We can specify separate rules for inbound,

33
00:01:50.00 --> 00:01:52.04
and outbound traffic.

34
00:01:52.04 --> 00:01:57.04
Very important - security group
rules are always permissive.

35
00:01:57.04 --> 00:02:01.07
We can't write rules that deny access.

36
00:02:01.07 --> 00:02:04.06
That means when we are
defining a security group,

37
00:02:04.06 --> 00:02:06.05
we can only write rules

38
00:02:06.05 --> 00:02:09.03
that allow traffic towards the instance,

39
00:02:09.03 --> 00:02:12.07
or from the instance, but
we cannot write a rule

40
00:02:12.07 --> 00:02:16.07
that blocks the traffic
or denies the traffic.

41
00:02:16.07 --> 00:02:19.04
Security groups are stateful in nature,

42
00:02:19.04 --> 00:02:23.04
which means if you send a
request from your instance,

43
00:02:23.04 --> 00:02:26.08
the response traffic for
that request is allowed

44
00:02:26.08 --> 00:02:32.06
to flow in regardless of
inbound security group rules.

45
00:02:32.06 --> 00:02:35.09
Let me explain this to
you with an example.

46
00:02:35.09 --> 00:02:39.03
So on the screen right now
I have an EC2 instance,

47
00:02:39.03 --> 00:02:40.08
and I have a security group,

48
00:02:40.08 --> 00:02:44.06
which is shown in red dotted lines.

49
00:02:44.06 --> 00:02:48.06
The EC2 instance is trying to
reach a server on the internet

50
00:02:48.06 --> 00:02:51.02
which is shown on the left hand side.

51
00:02:51.02 --> 00:02:54.00
When the EC2 instance sends the traffic,

52
00:02:54.00 --> 00:02:57.08
it first gets processed
by the security group.

53
00:02:57.08 --> 00:03:00.04
Let's assume that this traffic is allowed

54
00:03:00.04 --> 00:03:04.07
by the security group, so this
traffic reaches the server.

55
00:03:04.07 --> 00:03:07.02
Now when the server responds back,

56
00:03:07.02 --> 00:03:09.07
and when the response
hits the security group,

57
00:03:09.07 --> 00:03:12.02
is it gonna be evaluated again?

58
00:03:12.02 --> 00:03:14.00
The answer is no.

59
00:03:14.00 --> 00:03:16.01
When the server responds back,

60
00:03:16.01 --> 00:03:18.03
the traffic will be automatically allowed

61
00:03:18.03 --> 00:03:21.08
to reach that EC2 instance.

62
00:03:21.08 --> 00:03:26.01
It will not be processed against
the security rules again.

63
00:03:26.01 --> 00:03:28.09
Since the response belongs
to an existing session,

64
00:03:28.09 --> 00:03:30.08
it is allowed to flow in.

65
00:03:30.08 --> 00:03:35.02
And this is known as stateful inspection.

66
00:03:35.02 --> 00:03:37.07
Security groups are stateful in nature.

67
00:03:37.07 --> 00:03:39.09
They allows responses to flow in,

68
00:03:39.09 --> 00:03:45.00
regardless of the inbound
rule configuration.

69
00:03:45.00 --> 00:03:47.08
Let's now talk about security group rules.

70
00:03:47.08 --> 00:03:52.00
Every security group must have
a name, and a description,

71
00:03:52.00 --> 00:03:56.03
and these can be up to
255 characters in length.

72
00:03:56.03 --> 00:04:01.09
A security group name
cannot start with sg-.

73
00:04:01.09 --> 00:04:04.05
There are limits on the
number of security groups

74
00:04:04.05 --> 00:04:08.06
that you can create per
VPC, the number of rules

75
00:04:08.06 --> 00:04:11.06
that you can add to each security group,

76
00:04:11.06 --> 00:04:13.01
and the number of security groups

77
00:04:13.01 --> 00:04:18.05
that you can associate
with a network interface.

78
00:04:18.05 --> 00:04:20.06
When we configure a security group,

79
00:04:20.06 --> 00:04:23.03
these are the items
that we need to define.

80
00:04:23.03 --> 00:04:26.06
Number one, we must specify the protocol.

81
00:04:26.06 --> 00:04:32.03
The most common protocols
are TCP, UDP, and ICMP.

82
00:04:32.03 --> 00:04:35.07
Next, we need to specify the port range,

83
00:04:35.07 --> 00:04:38.09
which can be a single
port, or a range of ports,

84
00:04:38.09 --> 00:04:43.05
for TCP or UDP, or the custom protocol.

85
00:04:43.05 --> 00:04:47.06
Next, we specify the
source or destination.

86
00:04:47.06 --> 00:04:49.06
The source is for inbound rules,

87
00:04:49.06 --> 00:04:53.06
and destination is for outbound rules.

88
00:04:53.06 --> 00:04:57.04
If you must specify
individual IPV for addresses,

89
00:04:57.04 --> 00:05:01.09
they must be configured
with the /32 prefix length.

90
00:05:01.09 --> 00:05:07.02
For example, 4.2.2.2/32.

91
00:05:07.02 --> 00:05:11.01
If you need to specify
individual IPv6 addresses,

92
00:05:11.01 --> 00:05:15.02
they must use /128 prefix length.

93
00:05:15.02 --> 00:05:17.06
And you have an example
on the screen as well.

94
00:05:17.06 --> 00:05:22.07
As you can see it has a
prefix length of /128.

95
00:05:22.07 --> 00:05:25.03
Interestingly, the source or destination

96
00:05:25.03 --> 00:05:30.03
of a security group can also
be another security group.

97
00:05:30.03 --> 00:05:32.09
This allows EC2 instances associated

98
00:05:32.09 --> 00:05:35.02
with the specified security group

99
00:05:35.02 --> 00:05:40.04
to access instances associated
with this security group.

100
00:05:40.04 --> 00:05:42.02
If that sounds too confusing,

101
00:05:42.02 --> 00:05:45.01
I have an example coming up for you.

102
00:05:45.01 --> 00:05:50.04
Additionally, you may also
configure ICMP type and code.

103
00:05:50.04 --> 00:05:56.01
This is applicable only if you
select the protocol as ICMP.

104
00:05:56.01 --> 00:05:58.04
Now, I'm gonna show you an example

105
00:05:58.04 --> 00:06:01.02
of how a security group can be referenced

106
00:06:01.02 --> 00:06:04.05
within another security group.

107
00:06:04.05 --> 00:06:07.04
On the screen right now,
I have an EC2 instance

108
00:06:07.04 --> 00:06:09.09
which represents a web server.

109
00:06:09.09 --> 00:06:12.09
And as you can see, the
EC2 instance is associated

110
00:06:12.09 --> 00:06:15.02
with a security group which is shown

111
00:06:15.02 --> 00:06:17.08
with the red dotted line.

112
00:06:17.08 --> 00:06:20.00
Also, I have a database server,

113
00:06:20.00 --> 00:06:23.03
which has its own security group.

114
00:06:23.03 --> 00:06:27.02
The web server is connected
with the database server.

115
00:06:27.02 --> 00:06:31.02
People on the internet need
to access the web server.

116
00:06:31.02 --> 00:06:34.08
However, we do not want to
permit people on the internet

117
00:06:34.08 --> 00:06:38.05
to be directly accessing
the database server.

118
00:06:38.05 --> 00:06:41.02
That means users can
access the web server,

119
00:06:41.02 --> 00:06:43.03
and the web server has a connection

120
00:06:43.03 --> 00:06:45.03
with the database server.

121
00:06:45.03 --> 00:06:46.06
How do we make this happen?

122
00:06:46.06 --> 00:06:49.06
How do we make sure that people
on the internet can connect

123
00:06:49.06 --> 00:06:53.02
to the web server, but then
they cannot directly connect

124
00:06:53.02 --> 00:06:55.04
with the database server?

125
00:06:55.04 --> 00:06:57.01
The only connection that is permitted

126
00:06:57.01 --> 00:06:59.03
on the database server is that

127
00:06:59.03 --> 00:07:02.09
which originates from the web server.

128
00:07:02.09 --> 00:07:05.05
The security group associated
with the web server

129
00:07:05.05 --> 00:07:09.02
is called as web-server-sg.

130
00:07:09.02 --> 00:07:11.00
When I'm defining the security group

131
00:07:11.00 --> 00:07:15.04
for my database server, this
is how I'm gonna configure it.

132
00:07:15.04 --> 00:07:18.06
As you can see over here,
I've given it a name,

133
00:07:18.06 --> 00:07:21.01
which is called as database sg.

134
00:07:21.01 --> 00:07:22.09
I've given it a description.

135
00:07:22.09 --> 00:07:25.01
Notice the inbound traffic.

136
00:07:25.01 --> 00:07:29.01
I've selected MYSQL on TCP 3306,

137
00:07:29.01 --> 00:07:31.05
which is the traffic for database servers.

138
00:07:31.05 --> 00:07:34.06
The source is a custom IP address,

139
00:07:34.06 --> 00:07:38.07
but then, look at the
source that I've specified.

140
00:07:38.07 --> 00:07:41.01
In the source field I have given the name

141
00:07:41.01 --> 00:07:43.02
of the security group that is associated

142
00:07:43.02 --> 00:07:46.08
with the web server
which is web-server-sg.

143
00:07:46.08 --> 00:07:48.07
And you can see that over here.

144
00:07:48.07 --> 00:07:51.02
This means this security group,

145
00:07:51.02 --> 00:07:53.04
which is associated with
the database server,

146
00:07:53.04 --> 00:07:58.03
is only going to allow
inbound traffic on TCP 3306

147
00:07:58.03 --> 00:08:02.00
that originates from
any instance associated

148
00:08:02.00 --> 00:08:05.02
with web-server-sg.

149
00:08:05.02 --> 00:08:07.04
This is interesting because I do not have

150
00:08:07.04 --> 00:08:11.05
to specify the IP
address of my web server.

151
00:08:11.05 --> 00:08:13.06
Any instance that is associated

152
00:08:13.06 --> 00:08:17.00
with web-server-sg will
automatically be able

153
00:08:17.00 --> 00:08:20.00
to access the database servers.

154
00:08:20.00 --> 00:08:25.04
At the same time, it will
prevent any other connections.

155
00:08:25.04 --> 00:08:27.06
Isn't this really fantastic?

156
00:08:27.06 --> 00:08:30.02
We can actually reference security groups

157
00:08:30.02 --> 00:08:32.00
within security groups.

158
00:08:32.00 --> 00:08:36.06
And this applies to
outbound traffic as well.

159
00:08:36.06 --> 00:08:39.09
Moving on, some more
rules for security groups.

160
00:08:39.09 --> 00:08:43.04
If there is more than one
rule for a specific port,

161
00:08:43.04 --> 00:08:46.07
the most permissive rule is applied.

162
00:08:46.07 --> 00:08:48.09
For example, let's say you have a rule

163
00:08:48.09 --> 00:08:52.05
that allows access to TCP port 22,

164
00:08:52.05 --> 00:08:54.03
which is the SSH port number,

165
00:08:54.03 --> 00:08:59.09
from a specific IP address
which is 203.0.113.1.

166
00:08:59.09 --> 00:09:02.09
And you also have another
rule that allows access

167
00:09:02.09 --> 00:09:06.06
to TCP port 22 from everywhere.

168
00:09:06.06 --> 00:09:12.03
In this case, everyone would
have access to TCP port 22.

169
00:09:12.03 --> 00:09:17.02
The bottom line is, the most
permissive rule is applied.

170
00:09:17.02 --> 00:09:19.03
When multiple security
groups are associated

171
00:09:19.03 --> 00:09:23.04
with an instance, the rules
from each security group

172
00:09:23.04 --> 00:09:28.00
are effectively aggregated
to create one set of rules.

173
00:09:28.00 --> 00:09:30.04
And this set of rules is used to determine

174
00:09:30.04 --> 00:09:34.03
whether to allow access.

175
00:09:34.03 --> 00:09:38.05
We also have something called
as the default security group.

176
00:09:38.05 --> 00:09:44.07
Every AWS account has a
default security group per VPC.

177
00:09:44.07 --> 00:09:47.07
If you don't specify a
security group when you launch

178
00:09:47.07 --> 00:09:51.09
an EC2 instance, the instance
is automatically associated

179
00:09:51.09 --> 00:09:55.00
with the default security group.

180
00:09:55.00 --> 00:09:58.01
The default security
group is named as default,

181
00:09:58.01 --> 00:10:02.00
and it has and ID assigned by AWS.

182
00:10:02.00 --> 00:10:04.05
Please also note that we cannot delete

183
00:10:04.05 --> 00:10:07.02
the default security group.

184
00:10:07.02 --> 00:10:08.08
Well, that's it for this video.

185
00:10:08.08 --> 00:10:10.05
I hope you enjoyed this one.

186
00:10:10.05 --> 00:10:12.09
In the next video we're gonna do hands on,

187
00:10:12.09 --> 00:10:16.04
and we're gonna implement
all of these concepts.

188
00:10:16.04 --> 00:10:17.09
I'm excited to see you there

189
00:10:17.09 --> 00:10:19.03
and I'd like to thank you for watching.

190
00:10:19.03 --> 00:10:20.04
Thank you.
