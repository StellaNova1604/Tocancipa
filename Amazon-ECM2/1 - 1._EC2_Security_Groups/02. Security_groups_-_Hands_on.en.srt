00:00:00.01 --> 00:00:01.05
- [Instructor] Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.05 --> 00:00:03.05
In this video, we're gonna do some

3
00:00:03.05 --> 00:00:07.00
hands-on exercises on security groups.

4
00:00:07.00 --> 00:00:09.00
We'll implement all the concepts

5
00:00:09.00 --> 00:00:12.02
that we understood in the last video.

6
00:00:12.02 --> 00:00:15.03
If you're ready, let's begin.

7
00:00:15.03 --> 00:00:17.08
All right, so I'm here at the AWS console

8
00:00:17.08 --> 00:00:19.06
and, as you can see right now,

9
00:00:19.06 --> 00:00:22.00
I'm in the tab called Instances

10
00:00:22.00 --> 00:00:25.08
and I have one running EC2 instance.

11
00:00:25.08 --> 00:00:28.09
If I wanted to see what
security group has been assigned

12
00:00:28.09 --> 00:00:32.08
to this EC2 instance, I can
just drop down over here.

13
00:00:32.08 --> 00:00:34.09
In the panel over here, I can see that

14
00:00:34.09 --> 00:00:37.05
I have something called Security Groups

15
00:00:37.05 --> 00:00:39.05
and this is the name of the security group

16
00:00:39.05 --> 00:00:41.01
which is currently assigned.

17
00:00:41.01 --> 00:00:45.06
It's called as SSH and ICMP allowed.

18
00:00:45.06 --> 00:00:48.00
If I wanted to view the inbound rules

19
00:00:48.00 --> 00:00:51.05
I could click on view inbound
rules and we can see that

20
00:00:51.05 --> 00:00:54.06
a couple of protocols is allowed inbound.

21
00:00:54.06 --> 00:00:58.07
The first one is tcp,
port 22, which is SSH.

22
00:00:58.07 --> 00:01:01.06
It is allowed from all
source IP addresses.

23
00:01:01.06 --> 00:01:03.06
And then ICMP is also allowed

24
00:01:03.06 --> 00:01:06.08
from all the source IP addresses.

25
00:01:06.08 --> 00:01:09.04
How about creating some
new security groups?

26
00:01:09.04 --> 00:01:11.05
To create additional
security groups, we could

27
00:01:11.05 --> 00:01:15.05
go down to this tab over
here called Security Groups.

28
00:01:15.05 --> 00:01:19.02
Right now, I have about
four security groups

29
00:01:19.02 --> 00:01:24.09
out of which one is default
and three are user-created.

30
00:01:24.09 --> 00:01:27.04
If I wanted to create
a new security group,

31
00:01:27.04 --> 00:01:30.03
I can click on Create Security Group

32
00:01:30.03 --> 00:01:33.04
and we need to first
start by giving it a name.

33
00:01:33.04 --> 00:01:37.07
I'm gonna call this one as HTTP allowed.

34
00:01:37.07 --> 00:01:43.00
I'm also gonna give it a description.

35
00:01:43.00 --> 00:01:46.06
Okay, and then we can also select the VPC.

36
00:01:46.06 --> 00:01:50.07
In this case, I only have the default VPC.

37
00:01:50.07 --> 00:01:52.08
Over here, we have two tabs,

38
00:01:52.08 --> 00:01:55.09
one for Inbound and one for Outbound.

39
00:01:55.09 --> 00:02:00.01
As you can see, the Inbound
tab has no rules right now.

40
00:02:00.01 --> 00:02:02.08
But if I go to Outbound, by default,

41
00:02:02.08 --> 00:02:05.09
all outbound traffic is allowed.

42
00:02:05.09 --> 00:02:09.02
If I wanted to change that, I
can go to the right-hand side,

43
00:02:09.02 --> 00:02:12.08
and I can click on this
cross to remove that rule.

44
00:02:12.08 --> 00:02:15.00
If I wanted to add a new rule,

45
00:02:15.00 --> 00:02:17.03
I can click on Add Rule over here.

46
00:02:17.03 --> 00:02:19.05
Right now, I'm gonna
leave it the way it is

47
00:02:19.05 --> 00:02:22.07
and go back to Inbound
and I'm gonna add a rule

48
00:02:22.07 --> 00:02:25.08
to allow Inbound HTTP traffic.

49
00:02:25.08 --> 00:02:28.02
So I click on Add Rule over here.

50
00:02:28.02 --> 00:02:31.00
The first thing is the type of traffic.

51
00:02:31.00 --> 00:02:33.07
There are some pre-defined traffic types.

52
00:02:33.07 --> 00:02:35.00
You can choose from one of them.

53
00:02:35.00 --> 00:02:38.06
For example, you have SSH, SMTP, DNS,

54
00:02:38.06 --> 00:02:43.00
HTTP, LDAP, IMAP, et cetera.

55
00:02:43.00 --> 00:02:45.07
If you'd like to define
your custom traffic type,

56
00:02:45.07 --> 00:02:48.01
you could use one of
the options over here.

57
00:02:48.01 --> 00:02:51.09
For ICMP, you could use one
of these options over here.

58
00:02:51.09 --> 00:02:54.03
If you wanna allow everything inbound,

59
00:02:54.03 --> 00:02:56.08
you can go for All traffic.

60
00:02:56.08 --> 00:02:59.03
Right now, I'm trying to allow HTTP.

61
00:02:59.03 --> 00:03:02.04
So I'm gonna select this
one over here, HTTP.

62
00:03:02.04 --> 00:03:05.02
By default, it selects the protocol as TCP

63
00:03:05.02 --> 00:03:07.08
and the port number as 80.

64
00:03:07.08 --> 00:03:10.09
Over here, I can define
the source of that traffic.

65
00:03:10.09 --> 00:03:15.03
If I give My IP, it takes
my public IP address.

66
00:03:15.03 --> 00:03:17.06
If I give Custom, I can define

67
00:03:17.06 --> 00:03:19.09
my custom IP address range over here.

68
00:03:19.09 --> 00:03:25.04
Of, if I give Anywhere,
it takes all IP addresses.

69
00:03:25.04 --> 00:03:28.01
We can also give a description over here.

70
00:03:28.01 --> 00:03:31.03
If you wanted to add a new
rule, you can say Add Rule

71
00:03:31.03 --> 00:03:33.08
and you can define that traffic over here.

72
00:03:33.08 --> 00:03:35.05
Right now, I'm gonna remove that

73
00:03:35.05 --> 00:03:38.05
and have just one rule over here.

74
00:03:38.05 --> 00:03:40.08
Before I click on Create,
I also wanna show you

75
00:03:40.08 --> 00:03:42.04
something very interesting.

76
00:03:42.04 --> 00:03:45.06
If I select Custom over
here, notice what it says.

77
00:03:45.06 --> 00:03:48.08
Enter the CIDR, the IP or the name

78
00:03:48.08 --> 00:03:51.04
of another Security Group.

79
00:03:51.04 --> 00:03:53.07
Remember the example from the last video

80
00:03:53.07 --> 00:03:56.05
where we understood that
we only wanted to allow

81
00:03:56.05 --> 00:04:00.07
inbound traffic to the database
server from the web server.

82
00:04:00.07 --> 00:04:04.00
All other traffic should not be allowed.

83
00:04:04.00 --> 00:04:07.01
So, if you want to allow
traffic from instances

84
00:04:07.01 --> 00:04:09.07
that are associated with
a specific security group,

85
00:04:09.07 --> 00:04:12.02
you can call that
security group over here.

86
00:04:12.02 --> 00:04:15.08
For example, if I wanted
to allow inbound traffic

87
00:04:15.08 --> 00:04:19.00
from all EC2 instances associated with

88
00:04:19.00 --> 00:04:21.05
this security group called web-server,

89
00:04:21.05 --> 00:04:26.00
I could specify that as the source.

90
00:04:26.00 --> 00:04:27.07
So right now, I'm gonna say Anywhere

91
00:04:27.07 --> 00:04:31.00
to allow HTTP traffic from anywhere.

92
00:04:31.00 --> 00:04:33.07
And I'm gonna click on Create over here.

93
00:04:33.07 --> 00:04:35.08
So my security group has been created

94
00:04:35.08 --> 00:04:38.06
and it's over here, HTTP allowed.

95
00:04:38.06 --> 00:04:42.00
If you wanted to modify an
existing security group,

96
00:04:42.00 --> 00:04:44.07
you can go to Actions and you can say,

97
00:04:44.07 --> 00:04:48.00
Edit inbound rules or Edit outbound rules.

98
00:04:48.00 --> 00:04:53.01
Notice that you can also
add tags to security groups.

99
00:04:53.01 --> 00:04:55.06
If you wanted to view the
inbound and outbound rules,

100
00:04:55.06 --> 00:04:57.08
you can go to this tab
over here called Inbound.

101
00:04:57.08 --> 00:05:00.03
We can see that we have HTTP traffic.

102
00:05:00.03 --> 00:05:02.08
Notice that it shows you two rows.

103
00:05:02.08 --> 00:05:05.07
This one is for any IPv4 traffic

104
00:05:05.07 --> 00:05:08.07
and this one is for any IPv6 traffic.

105
00:05:08.07 --> 00:05:10.04
And if you wanted to
view the outbound rules,

106
00:05:10.04 --> 00:05:13.06
you could go over here to
the tab called Outbound

107
00:05:13.06 --> 00:05:17.02
and we can see that everything
is allowed outbound.

108
00:05:17.02 --> 00:05:19.01
Now let's try to associate this

109
00:05:19.01 --> 00:05:21.07
with an existing EC2 instance.

110
00:05:21.07 --> 00:05:24.00
So I go back to Instances over here.

111
00:05:24.00 --> 00:05:26.04
I have my running instance,

112
00:05:26.04 --> 00:05:28.08
which is associated
with one security group,

113
00:05:28.08 --> 00:05:32.08
which is SSH and ICMP allowed.

114
00:05:32.08 --> 00:05:34.07
To associate another security group,

115
00:05:34.07 --> 00:05:39.06
I would go to Actions, Networking,
Change Security Groups.

116
00:05:39.06 --> 00:05:42.04
We can see that we have
one allowed right now,

117
00:05:42.04 --> 00:05:43.08
or one enabled right now,

118
00:05:43.08 --> 00:05:45.07
and I'm also going to enable this one,

119
00:05:45.07 --> 00:05:48.04
which is HTTP allowed.

120
00:05:48.04 --> 00:05:51.02
And I'm gonna click on
Assign Security Groups.

121
00:05:51.02 --> 00:05:53.05
So now, we have a couple
of security groups

122
00:05:53.05 --> 00:05:56.02
associated with that EC2 instance.

123
00:05:56.02 --> 00:05:58.09
If I click on view inbound rules,

124
00:05:58.09 --> 00:06:04.04
we can now see that we
have port 22 tcp and icmp

125
00:06:04.04 --> 00:06:08.02
from the first security group,
you can see that over here.

126
00:06:08.02 --> 00:06:12.02
And we have port 80, tcp, from
the second security group,

127
00:06:12.02 --> 00:06:15.04
which is called as HTTP allowed.

128
00:06:15.04 --> 00:06:18.05
So, in the last video, we
said that we can attach

129
00:06:18.05 --> 00:06:22.04
multiple security groups
to the same EC2 instance.

130
00:06:22.04 --> 00:06:26.00
In this case, AWS would create
a larger security group,

131
00:06:26.00 --> 00:06:28.01
which is a combination of everything,

132
00:06:28.01 --> 00:06:30.05
and that would be used to decide

133
00:06:30.05 --> 00:06:34.09
what traffic is allowed
inbound or outbound.

134
00:06:34.09 --> 00:06:36.07
Remember we also understood that,

135
00:06:36.07 --> 00:06:39.00
changes to security groups are applied

136
00:06:39.00 --> 00:06:41.07
automatically and immediately.

137
00:06:41.07 --> 00:06:43.01
Let's take a look at that.

138
00:06:43.01 --> 00:06:46.05
So right now, we have
ICMP allowed inbound.

139
00:06:46.05 --> 00:06:49.01
Let's try to ping this EC2 instance.

140
00:06:49.01 --> 00:06:51.01
So I'm gonna copy that IP address

141
00:06:51.01 --> 00:06:54.09
and I'm gonna open up a terminal.

142
00:06:54.09 --> 00:06:58.09
And I'm gonna try and
ping that IP address.

143
00:06:58.09 --> 00:07:01.00
And, as we can see that
we're getting replies

144
00:07:01.00 --> 00:07:03.03
from that EC2 instance.

145
00:07:03.03 --> 00:07:07.05
Now let's remove ICMP
from that security group.

146
00:07:07.05 --> 00:07:09.09
So I'm gonna come back to the AWS console,

147
00:07:09.09 --> 00:07:12.02
go to Security Groups.

148
00:07:12.02 --> 00:07:14.02
This is the security group
which has been applied

149
00:07:14.02 --> 00:07:18.05
to that EC2 instance,
SSH and ICMP allowed.

150
00:07:18.05 --> 00:07:23.04
We can see that in the
Inbound tab, ICMP is allowed.

151
00:07:23.04 --> 00:07:27.01
Now, I'm gonna go to
Actions, Edit inbound rules,

152
00:07:27.01 --> 00:07:30.00
and I'm gonna remove both of these items.

153
00:07:30.00 --> 00:07:35.01
ICMP from IPv4 and ICMP from all IPv6.

154
00:07:35.01 --> 00:07:40.00
I'm gonna remove that and click on Save.

155
00:07:40.00 --> 00:07:43.06
So, at this point, only SSH
traffic is being allowed.

156
00:07:43.06 --> 00:07:47.00
If we go back to Instances,
click on the EC2 instance,

157
00:07:47.00 --> 00:07:50.01
we can see that, when we
click on view inbound rules,

158
00:07:50.01 --> 00:07:52.03
there's no ICMP over here.

159
00:07:52.03 --> 00:07:53.08
When I go back to my terminal,

160
00:07:53.08 --> 00:07:58.01
you can see that the
ping is still working.

161
00:07:58.01 --> 00:07:59.06
How is that possible?

162
00:07:59.06 --> 00:08:01.06
Well, the reason is, even though

163
00:08:01.06 --> 00:08:04.05
the rule is applied immediately,

164
00:08:04.05 --> 00:08:07.04
the existing conditions are not affected.

165
00:08:07.04 --> 00:08:10.00
And this is a very critical learning.

166
00:08:10.00 --> 00:08:12.05
Even if you make a change
to your security group,

167
00:08:12.05 --> 00:08:15.08
existing connections
stay the way they are.

168
00:08:15.08 --> 00:08:17.01
But notice what happens if I do

169
00:08:17.01 --> 00:08:19.07
a control + C to terminate that.

170
00:08:19.07 --> 00:08:23.00
I hit the up arrow, which
is ping, and the IP address,

171
00:08:23.00 --> 00:08:27.00
and then when I do an
Enter, you'll notice that

172
00:08:27.00 --> 00:08:29.03
now I'm getting timed out.

173
00:08:29.03 --> 00:08:31.03
New connections take effect.

174
00:08:31.03 --> 00:08:34.05
Existing connections
stay the way they are.

175
00:08:34.05 --> 00:08:36.03
Well, that's it for this video.

176
00:08:36.03 --> 00:08:37.08
I hope you enjoyed this one.

177
00:08:37.08 --> 00:08:39.03
I'd like to thank you for watching

178
00:08:39.03 --> 00:08:40.05
and I'll catch you in the next video.

179
00:08:40.05 --> 00:08:41.06
Thank you.
