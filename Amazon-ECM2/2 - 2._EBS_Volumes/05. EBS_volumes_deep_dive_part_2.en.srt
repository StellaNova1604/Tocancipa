00:00:03.08 --> 00:00:07.01
- [Instructor] Let's now
talk about EBS volume types.

2
00:00:07.01 --> 00:00:10.07
Amazon EBS volumes fall
into two categories

3
00:00:10.07 --> 00:00:14.01
based on performance
characteristics and pricing.

4
00:00:14.01 --> 00:00:18.03
Number one, we have SSD-backed volumes.

5
00:00:18.03 --> 00:00:21.03
These are optimized for
transactional workloads

6
00:00:21.03 --> 00:00:24.02
involving frequent read
or write operations

7
00:00:24.02 --> 00:00:26.03
with small I/O size,

8
00:00:26.03 --> 00:00:30.06
where the dominant
performance attribute is IOPS,

9
00:00:30.06 --> 00:00:33.03
input/output per second.

10
00:00:33.03 --> 00:00:38.03
Number two, we have HDD-backed
volumes or hard disk drives,

11
00:00:38.03 --> 00:00:41.04
optimized for large streaming workloads

12
00:00:41.04 --> 00:00:47.03
where throughput is a better
performance measure than IOPS.

13
00:00:47.03 --> 00:00:49.07
We go for SSD volumes when we are looking

14
00:00:49.07 --> 00:00:53.02
for a very high number of IOPS,

15
00:00:53.02 --> 00:00:55.07
whereas we go for HDD-backed volumes

16
00:00:55.07 --> 00:00:57.06
when we are looking at throughput

17
00:00:57.06 --> 00:01:00.02
as a performance attribute.

18
00:01:00.02 --> 00:01:03.06
Talking about SSD volumes,
we have two types.

19
00:01:03.06 --> 00:01:05.06
We have general purpose SSD,

20
00:01:05.06 --> 00:01:08.04
and then we have provisioned IOPS.

21
00:01:08.04 --> 00:01:10.09
With general purpose SSD, the volume size

22
00:01:10.09 --> 00:01:15.06
can be between 1 GB and 16 TB.

23
00:01:15.06 --> 00:01:20.07
While for provisioned IOPS,
it can be 4 GB to 16 TB.

24
00:01:20.07 --> 00:01:24.02
The max IOPS for general
purpose is 10,000,

25
00:01:24.02 --> 00:01:27.04
which means 10,000
input/output per second,

26
00:01:27.04 --> 00:01:32.04
whereas for provisioned
IOPS, the max can be 32,000.

27
00:01:32.04 --> 00:01:34.00
You see that we also have differences

28
00:01:34.00 --> 00:01:36.05
in terms of throughput volume,

29
00:01:36.05 --> 00:01:40.03
and the dominant performance
attribute is IOPS

30
00:01:40.03 --> 00:01:41.09
for both of them,

31
00:01:41.09 --> 00:01:45.04
which means we use IOPS
as a comparison attribute

32
00:01:45.04 --> 00:01:48.00
for SSD volumes.

33
00:01:48.00 --> 00:01:52.01
Use cases, general purpose
is suited for most workloads,

34
00:01:52.01 --> 00:01:54.06
boot volumes, virtual desktops,

35
00:01:54.06 --> 00:01:57.03
low latency interactive applications,

36
00:01:57.03 --> 00:01:59.05
dev and test environments.

37
00:01:59.05 --> 00:02:01.02
While provisioned IOPS is suitable

38
00:02:01.02 --> 00:02:03.06
for critical business applications

39
00:02:03.06 --> 00:02:07.01
that require sustained IOPS performance,

40
00:02:07.01 --> 00:02:13.08
large database workloads such
as MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.

41
00:02:13.08 --> 00:02:17.08
Talking about HDD volume types,
we have a couple of them.

42
00:02:17.08 --> 00:02:20.02
Number one is throughput optimized

43
00:02:20.02 --> 00:02:23.05
and number two is cold HDD.

44
00:02:23.05 --> 00:02:26.04
The volume size is the same, 500 GB,

45
00:02:26.04 --> 00:02:28.06
all the way up to 16 TB.

46
00:02:28.06 --> 00:02:32.06
The max IOPS is 500 for
throughput optimized,

47
00:02:32.06 --> 00:02:35.06
and 250 for cold HDD.

48
00:02:35.06 --> 00:02:38.03
You can see that there's a
difference in max throughput

49
00:02:38.03 --> 00:02:40.03
per volume as well.

50
00:02:40.03 --> 00:02:44.08
The dominant attribute over
here is MiBs per second

51
00:02:44.08 --> 00:02:47.08
or throughput.

52
00:02:47.08 --> 00:02:49.05
The use case for throughput optimized

53
00:02:49.05 --> 00:02:52.07
is streaming workloads
that require consistent,

54
00:02:52.07 --> 00:02:55.04
fast throughput at a low price,

55
00:02:55.04 --> 00:03:01.04
as well as big data, data
warehouses, log processing, etc.

56
00:03:01.04 --> 00:03:05.03
Please keep in mind this
cannot be a boot volume.

57
00:03:05.03 --> 00:03:08.04
Remember in the video where
we launched an EC2 instance?

58
00:03:08.04 --> 00:03:11.03
We saw that the root
volume did not allow us

59
00:03:11.03 --> 00:03:15.04
to select an HDD-backed volume.

60
00:03:15.04 --> 00:03:19.06
Use cases for cold HDD are
throughput-oriented storage

61
00:03:19.06 --> 00:03:23.07
for large volumes where data
is infrequently accessed

62
00:03:23.07 --> 00:03:27.02
and lowest storage cost is important.

63
00:03:27.02 --> 00:03:32.01
Again, it cannot be a boot volume.

64
00:03:32.01 --> 00:03:34.07
The last one is EBS magnetic,

65
00:03:34.07 --> 00:03:39.00
it is also known as
previous generation HDD.

66
00:03:39.00 --> 00:03:42.05
Magnetic volumes are
backed by magnetic drives,

67
00:03:42.05 --> 00:03:46.06
suited for workloads where
data is accessed infrequently,

68
00:03:46.06 --> 00:03:48.06
and where low cost storage

69
00:03:48.06 --> 00:03:52.05
for small volume sizes is important.

70
00:03:52.05 --> 00:03:55.00
Over here, you have volume sizes from 1 GB

71
00:03:55.00 --> 00:04:00.05
all the way up to 1 TB and
the max IOPS is 40 to 200.

72
00:04:00.05 --> 00:04:02.07
Well, that's it for this video.

73
00:04:02.07 --> 00:04:04.03
I'd like to thank you for watching,

74
00:04:04.03 --> 00:04:05.06
and I'll catch you in the next video.

75
00:04:05.06 --> 00:04:06.05
Thank you.
