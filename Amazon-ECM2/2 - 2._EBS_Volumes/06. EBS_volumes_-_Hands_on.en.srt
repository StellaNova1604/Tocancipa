1
00:00:01.02 --> 00:00:02.06
- [Instructor] Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.06 --> 00:00:05.08
In this video, we're gonna
do some hands on stuff

3
00:00:05.08 --> 00:00:07.07
with EBS Volumes.

4
00:00:07.07 --> 00:00:11.02
If you are ready, let's begin.

5
00:00:11.02 --> 00:00:13.05
All right, I'm here at the AWS console

6
00:00:13.05 --> 00:00:14.09
and as you can see right now,

7
00:00:14.09 --> 00:00:19.01
I do not have any running EC2 instances.

8
00:00:19.01 --> 00:00:21.09
First of all, I'm gonna
launch an EC2 instance.

9
00:00:21.09 --> 00:00:23.08
I'm gonna click on Launch Instance

10
00:00:23.08 --> 00:00:25.03
and I'm gonna select the first one,

11
00:00:25.03 --> 00:00:28.04
which is Amazon Linux AMI

12
00:00:28.04 --> 00:00:32.00
and I'm gonna select the size as t2_micro.

13
00:00:32.00 --> 00:00:35.07
I'm gonna select Next for
Configure Instance Details.

14
00:00:35.07 --> 00:00:38.06
Over here, I'm not gonna make any changes

15
00:00:38.06 --> 00:00:40.02
and I'm gonna move on to the next one,

16
00:00:40.02 --> 00:00:42.07
which is Add Storage.

17
00:00:42.07 --> 00:00:45.03
Over here, we can see that by default,

18
00:00:45.03 --> 00:00:47.07
it has a Root volume

19
00:00:47.07 --> 00:00:52.03
and the size of the root
volume is eight gigs.

20
00:00:52.03 --> 00:00:55.01
If we launched a Windows EC2 instance,

21
00:00:55.01 --> 00:00:58.07
the size of the root
volume would be 30 gigs.

22
00:00:58.07 --> 00:01:01.07
Over here, we can select the volume type.

23
00:01:01.07 --> 00:01:04.04
Root volumes allow only three volume types

24
00:01:04.04 --> 00:01:07.07
out of the five that we
discussed the last video

25
00:01:07.07 --> 00:01:09.05
and here you can see the IOPS,

26
00:01:09.05 --> 00:01:11.08
which is input/output per second

27
00:01:11.08 --> 00:01:13.03
and here we have a check box

28
00:01:13.03 --> 00:01:16.08
that says Delete on Termination.

29
00:01:16.08 --> 00:01:18.08
Having this turned on means that

30
00:01:18.08 --> 00:01:21.07
when you terminate your EC2 instance,

31
00:01:21.07 --> 00:01:24.04
the volume will also be terminated.

32
00:01:24.04 --> 00:01:27.04
However, if you'd like
to retain the volume,

33
00:01:27.04 --> 00:01:30.02
even if the EC2 instance
has been terminated,

34
00:01:30.02 --> 00:01:32.08
you can uncheck this box over here.

35
00:01:32.08 --> 00:01:34.06
Let's do that right now.

36
00:01:34.06 --> 00:01:39.02
Also, notice that you can
add a new volume over here.

37
00:01:39.02 --> 00:01:41.05
We can select the size of that new volume

38
00:01:41.05 --> 00:01:43.00
and notice that now,

39
00:01:43.00 --> 00:01:47.05
we have all the five
volume types available.

40
00:01:47.05 --> 00:01:50.01
We can also choose to
delete on termination

41
00:01:50.01 --> 00:01:53.06
and we can also encrypt
this volume over here.

42
00:01:53.06 --> 00:01:57.02
Right now, I'm just gonna
leave it at the Root volume

43
00:01:57.02 --> 00:01:59.00
and I'm gonna select Next.

44
00:01:59.00 --> 00:02:01.00
I'm gonna add a security group.

45
00:02:01.00 --> 00:02:03.01
I'm gonna select any one of them,

46
00:02:03.01 --> 00:02:07.06
maybe this one, review and
launch and click on Launch.

47
00:02:07.06 --> 00:02:11.00
I'll acknowledge that I
have the key pair with me

48
00:02:11.00 --> 00:02:13.08
and I'll click on Launch Instances.

49
00:02:13.08 --> 00:02:16.07
I go down over here and
I'll click on View Instances

50
00:02:16.07 --> 00:02:21.07
and we can see that the EC2
instance is being provisioned.

51
00:02:21.07 --> 00:02:23.09
While this is happening,
let's go down over here

52
00:02:23.09 --> 00:02:26.03
to Volumes and we can see that

53
00:02:26.03 --> 00:02:29.02
the volume appears over here as well.

54
00:02:29.02 --> 00:02:32.08
Here's the volume ID and
the size is eight gigs

55
00:02:32.08 --> 00:02:36.09
and notice over here, it
says the state is in-use.

56
00:02:36.09 --> 00:02:41.03
That means, it is actually
attached to an EC2 instance.

57
00:02:41.03 --> 00:02:43.02
If you're not sure of the EC2 instance

58
00:02:43.02 --> 00:02:45.08
to which it is attached,
you can go down over here

59
00:02:45.08 --> 00:02:48.03
and we can click on the instance ID

60
00:02:48.03 --> 00:02:51.04
or we can do it from here as well.

61
00:02:51.04 --> 00:02:53.03
So if I click on this one over here,

62
00:02:53.03 --> 00:02:56.02
it takes me back to Instances
and this is the instance

63
00:02:56.02 --> 00:02:58.08
that we launched right now.

64
00:02:58.08 --> 00:03:02.07
Now, I'm gonna try and
terminate this EC2 instance,

65
00:03:02.07 --> 00:03:07.00
Actions, Instance State, Terminate,

66
00:03:07.00 --> 00:03:08.03
Yes, Terminate.

67
00:03:08.03 --> 00:03:09.04
Let's go back to Volumes

68
00:03:09.04 --> 00:03:12.04
and see what happens to that volume.

69
00:03:12.04 --> 00:03:14.09
It can take about a minute or so

70
00:03:14.09 --> 00:03:17.01
for the EC2 instance to terminate

71
00:03:17.01 --> 00:03:18.05
so while that is happening,

72
00:03:18.05 --> 00:03:21.06
let's see how we can create
an additional volume.

73
00:03:21.06 --> 00:03:24.02
So, I'm gonna click on
Create Volume over here.

74
00:03:24.02 --> 00:03:27.07
Notice we have all the
five types to choose from.

75
00:03:27.07 --> 00:03:28.09
I'm gonna select the first one,

76
00:03:28.09 --> 00:03:31.04
which is General Purpose SSD.

77
00:03:31.04 --> 00:03:34.02
We can see that the
minimum has to be one gig

78
00:03:34.02 --> 00:03:37.04
and the max can be 16 gigs.

79
00:03:37.04 --> 00:03:41.00
For now, I'm gonna keep it as two gigs

80
00:03:41.00 --> 00:03:43.06
and we can select the availability zone.

81
00:03:43.06 --> 00:03:46.02
Depending on the region
that you selected over here,

82
00:03:46.02 --> 00:03:48.02
you can select the availability zones.

83
00:03:48.02 --> 00:03:53.01
So in Mumbai, we only have a
couple of availability zones.

84
00:03:53.01 --> 00:03:54.08
If you wanted to create the volume

85
00:03:54.08 --> 00:03:56.04
from an existing snapshot,

86
00:03:56.04 --> 00:03:58.03
we can select that snapshot from here

87
00:03:58.03 --> 00:04:00.08
or the Snapshot ID from here.

88
00:04:00.08 --> 00:04:04.09
Notice we also have the
option to encrypt this volume.

89
00:04:04.09 --> 00:04:06.04
If I select this option,

90
00:04:06.04 --> 00:04:09.04
I can select the encryption key as well.

91
00:04:09.04 --> 00:04:11.08
I can use the default encryption key

92
00:04:11.08 --> 00:04:16.05
or I can also use my own
custom encryption key.

93
00:04:16.05 --> 00:04:18.08
Right now, I'm gonna say no to this.

94
00:04:18.08 --> 00:04:20.02
I don't wanna encrypt that

95
00:04:20.02 --> 00:04:23.00
and we can also add tags to the volume

96
00:04:23.00 --> 00:04:26.02
for identification and filtering.

97
00:04:26.02 --> 00:04:30.02
I'm gonna say Create Volume and
the volume has been created.

98
00:04:30.02 --> 00:04:32.05
We have the Volume ID.

99
00:04:32.05 --> 00:04:34.04
So at this point, you can see that

100
00:04:34.04 --> 00:04:36.00
there is a couple of volumes.

101
00:04:36.00 --> 00:04:37.08
Now notice the first one.

102
00:04:37.08 --> 00:04:40.04
This was from that EC2 instance.

103
00:04:40.04 --> 00:04:43.00
It has now changed to available

104
00:04:43.00 --> 00:04:45.09
because the EC2 instance
to which it was attached

105
00:04:45.09 --> 00:04:48.02
has now been terminated

106
00:04:48.02 --> 00:04:50.03
and since we did not check that box,

107
00:04:50.03 --> 00:04:53.01
which said Delete on Termination,

108
00:04:53.01 --> 00:04:55.00
the volume is still available

109
00:04:55.00 --> 00:04:58.05
even though the EC2 instance
has been terminated.

110
00:04:58.05 --> 00:05:02.02
The good part is, now we
can attach this volume

111
00:05:02.02 --> 00:05:05.08
to another EC2 instance.

112
00:05:05.08 --> 00:05:08.08
Meanwhile, the second
volume has also moved in

113
00:05:08.08 --> 00:05:12.00
to the available state.

114
00:05:12.00 --> 00:05:15.05
Let's say we wanted to modify
the size of that volume.

115
00:05:15.05 --> 00:05:16.09
Let's say this is two gigs

116
00:05:16.09 --> 00:05:19.05
and I wanted to make it four gigs.

117
00:05:19.05 --> 00:05:20.07
How would I do that?

118
00:05:20.07 --> 00:05:24.05
So, you go to Actions and
you can say Modify Volume.

119
00:05:24.05 --> 00:05:26.01
The current size is two gigs.

120
00:05:26.01 --> 00:05:30.02
So I can change it to maybe four gigs

121
00:05:30.02 --> 00:05:33.01
but notice what happens if I do one gig.

122
00:05:33.01 --> 00:05:36.07
It says, "The size of a
volume can only be increased,

123
00:05:36.07 --> 00:05:38.08
not decreased."

124
00:05:38.08 --> 00:05:41.00
This is a very important concept.

125
00:05:41.00 --> 00:05:43.05
Volumes can only be increased in size

126
00:05:43.05 --> 00:05:46.09
but not decreased in size.

127
00:05:46.09 --> 00:05:50.03
How about moving volumes
across availability zones?

128
00:05:50.03 --> 00:05:52.05
For example, you can see that this volume

129
00:05:52.05 --> 00:05:55.02
was created in ap-south-1a.

130
00:05:55.02 --> 00:05:58.03
If I wanted to move this to ap-south-1b,

131
00:05:58.03 --> 00:05:59.04
can I do that?

132
00:05:59.04 --> 00:06:02.03
The answer is not directly.

133
00:06:02.03 --> 00:06:03.01
There is no option

134
00:06:03.01 --> 00:06:05.07
to change the availability zone from here.

135
00:06:05.07 --> 00:06:07.00
So, what we would have to do is,

136
00:06:07.00 --> 00:06:10.03
we would have to create
a snapshot of this volume

137
00:06:10.03 --> 00:06:13.03
and then we would have
to restore that snapshot

138
00:06:13.03 --> 00:06:15.07
to another availability zone.

139
00:06:15.07 --> 00:06:17.05
And we'll talk about snapshots

140
00:06:17.05 --> 00:06:20.03
in one of the upcoming videos.

141
00:06:20.03 --> 00:06:23.07
If we wanted to attach this
volume to an EC2 instance,

142
00:06:23.07 --> 00:06:27.05
we can use this option over
here called Attach Volume

143
00:06:27.05 --> 00:06:30.07
and we can select the
EC2 instance from here.

144
00:06:30.07 --> 00:06:35.00
Right now, I do not have
any running EC2 instance.

145
00:06:35.00 --> 00:06:38.07
Please keep in mind, this
is not the only step.

146
00:06:38.07 --> 00:06:42.06
Over here, you're just
mapping it to an EC2 instance

147
00:06:42.06 --> 00:06:45.02
but then we also need to make some changes

148
00:06:45.02 --> 00:06:49.00
on the instance itself
like mounting the volume

149
00:06:49.00 --> 00:06:53.03
and we'll understand that
in the upcoming videos.

150
00:06:53.03 --> 00:06:55.02
If you wanted to check the statistics,

151
00:06:55.02 --> 00:06:57.03
we have those statistics over here.

152
00:06:57.03 --> 00:07:01.07
We can see the Volume ID, the
size, when was it created,

153
00:07:01.07 --> 00:07:07.02
the volume type, what's
the availability zone, etc.

154
00:07:07.02 --> 00:07:09.04
If you wanted to delete a volume,

155
00:07:09.04 --> 00:07:11.02
we can delete that from here.

156
00:07:11.02 --> 00:07:14.02
However, if it is attached
to an EC2 instance,

157
00:07:14.02 --> 00:07:17.03
you would not be able to
delete it till you detach it

158
00:07:17.03 --> 00:07:18.08
so you can detach it from here.

159
00:07:18.08 --> 00:07:23.07
Right now it's not attached
so it's grayed out over here.

160
00:07:23.07 --> 00:07:25.06
All right, so that's about EBS Volumes.

161
00:07:25.06 --> 00:07:27.02
I hope you enjoyed this video.

162
00:07:27.02 --> 00:07:28.05
I'd like to thank you for watching

163
00:07:28.05 --> 00:07:30.04
and I'll catch you in the next video.

164
00:07:30.04 --> 00:07:31.03
Thank you.
