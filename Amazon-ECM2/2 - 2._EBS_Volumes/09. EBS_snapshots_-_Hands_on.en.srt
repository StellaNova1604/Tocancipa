00:00:01.00 --> 00:00:02.03
- [Instructor] Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.03 --> 00:00:04.03
In this video, we're gonna look at

3
00:00:04.03 --> 00:00:07.05
EBS snapshots live in action.

4
00:00:07.05 --> 00:00:10.04
All the concepts that we
discussed in the last video,

5
00:00:10.04 --> 00:00:13.08
we're gonna implement
all of these concepts.

6
00:00:13.08 --> 00:00:16.06
All right, so I'm logged
into the AWS console

7
00:00:16.06 --> 00:00:19.01
and right now I'm in the EC2 section

8
00:00:19.01 --> 00:00:22.05
and I'm gonna first click on Volumes.

9
00:00:22.05 --> 00:00:26.01
As you can see, right now
I do not have any volumes.

10
00:00:26.01 --> 00:00:28.07
So I'm gonna first create a new volume.

11
00:00:28.07 --> 00:00:30.07
So I'm gonna say, Create Volume.

12
00:00:30.07 --> 00:00:33.06
And we can choose any one
of these types over here.

13
00:00:33.06 --> 00:00:36.02
I'm gonna go for a General Purpose SSD.

14
00:00:36.02 --> 00:00:39.04
And I'm gonna give the size as 1 gig.

15
00:00:39.04 --> 00:00:45.00
And I'm gonna choose the
Availability Zone as us-east-1a.

16
00:00:45.00 --> 00:00:46.08
We can choose to encrypt the volume,

17
00:00:46.08 --> 00:00:51.00
but right now, I'm just
gonna say Create Volume.

18
00:00:51.00 --> 00:00:53.08
So, the volume has now been created.

19
00:00:53.08 --> 00:00:55.01
We can see that over here.

20
00:00:55.01 --> 00:00:57.05
And, the State of available means that

21
00:00:57.05 --> 00:01:02.08
it has not been associated or
attached with an EC2 instance.

22
00:01:02.08 --> 00:01:06.01
Let's try to create a
snapshot for this volume.

23
00:01:06.01 --> 00:01:07.09
So I'll go to Actions over here

24
00:01:07.09 --> 00:01:11.02
and I'm gonna say Create Snapshot.

25
00:01:11.02 --> 00:01:13.00
At this point, we can give it a name.

26
00:01:13.00 --> 00:01:15.03
Let's call it as Snap-1.

27
00:01:15.03 --> 00:01:19.02
Notice that it says Encrypted No.

28
00:01:19.02 --> 00:01:21.09
Since the original
volume was not encrypted,

29
00:01:21.09 --> 00:01:25.00
I do not have the option
to encrypt the snapshot.

30
00:01:25.00 --> 00:01:27.08
I'm gonna say, Create, and

31
00:01:27.08 --> 00:01:29.05
the snapshot creation has started.

32
00:01:29.05 --> 00:01:32.01
We can click over here
or we can close this

33
00:01:32.01 --> 00:01:34.05
and go to Shapshots over here.

34
00:01:34.05 --> 00:01:37.03
And the snapshot has been created.

35
00:01:37.03 --> 00:01:41.02
Now, if we wanted to restore
the snapshot into a volume,

36
00:01:41.02 --> 00:01:45.07
we could go to Actions, and
we can say Create Volume.

37
00:01:45.07 --> 00:01:47.01
Let's try that.

38
00:01:47.01 --> 00:01:50.02
Notice that, when you're
restoring back to a volume,

39
00:01:50.02 --> 00:01:53.08
you have the option to change the type,

40
00:01:53.08 --> 00:01:54.08
which is interesting.

41
00:01:54.08 --> 00:01:58.08
We also have the option
to change the size.

42
00:01:58.08 --> 00:02:01.06
And, most important,
we also have the option

43
00:02:01.06 --> 00:02:04.09
to change the Availability
Zone, which means,

44
00:02:04.09 --> 00:02:08.07
if we want to move a volume
across Availability Zones,

45
00:02:08.07 --> 00:02:11.04
we first need to create
a snapshot and then

46
00:02:11.04 --> 00:02:15.00
restore the snapshot into
the new Availability Zone.

47
00:02:15.00 --> 00:02:19.00
For example, I'm gonna say, us-east-1b

48
00:02:19.00 --> 00:02:24.01
and I'm gonna click on Create Volume.

49
00:02:24.01 --> 00:02:27.05
I'm gonna close this and go
back to Volumes over here.

50
00:02:27.05 --> 00:02:30.03
And we can see that now
we have two volumes.

51
00:02:30.03 --> 00:02:33.09
This is the original one,
which was us-east-1a.

52
00:02:33.09 --> 00:02:38.06
And this is the restored
volume, us-east-1b.

53
00:02:38.06 --> 00:02:40.01
Let's try this one more time.

54
00:02:40.01 --> 00:02:43.02
But this time, we're gonna
go for an encrypted volume.

55
00:02:43.02 --> 00:02:45.03
So Create Volume.

56
00:02:45.03 --> 00:02:48.00
GP2, General Purpose SSD.

57
00:02:48.00 --> 00:02:49.07
Size is 1 gig.

58
00:02:49.07 --> 00:02:53.00
And the Availability Zone is us-east-1a.

59
00:02:53.00 --> 00:02:57.00
But this time I'm gonna
say Encrypt this volume.

60
00:02:57.00 --> 00:03:00.01
You have the option to
select the default key.

61
00:03:00.01 --> 00:03:04.02
Or, if you have a custom key,
you could choose that as well.

62
00:03:04.02 --> 00:03:08.06
In fact, let me take you to Mumbai

63
00:03:08.06 --> 00:03:12.03
where I believe I have a
new key present over there.

64
00:03:12.03 --> 00:03:14.06
So I'm gonna take you back over here.

65
00:03:14.06 --> 00:03:17.02
Notice the region has
now changed to Mumbai.

66
00:03:17.02 --> 00:03:20.01
And I'm gonna change the size to 1 gig.

67
00:03:20.01 --> 00:03:24.00
And I'm gonna say Encryption, turned on.

68
00:03:24.00 --> 00:03:27.09
Over here you'll notice that I
have two keys to choose from.

69
00:03:27.09 --> 00:03:31.04
This is the default key and
this is the key that I created.

70
00:03:31.04 --> 00:03:36.09
So you could use your
own custom keys as well.

71
00:03:36.09 --> 00:03:38.01
I'm gonna go back over here

72
00:03:38.01 --> 00:03:40.09
and I'm gonna perform the lab from here.

73
00:03:40.09 --> 00:03:43.08
I'm gonna use the default key.

74
00:03:43.08 --> 00:03:48.03
And I'm gonna say, Create
Volume, click on Close,

75
00:03:48.03 --> 00:03:53.02
and now we can see the
volume has been created.

76
00:03:53.02 --> 00:03:55.07
So I'm just gonna go down and
verify that this is the one.

77
00:03:55.07 --> 00:03:57.04
Yup, encrypted.

78
00:03:57.04 --> 00:04:02.09
And let's give it a name
for identification purpose.

79
00:04:02.09 --> 00:04:05.05
Let's call it as Encrypted Volume.

80
00:04:05.05 --> 00:04:07.06
Now I'm gonna create a
snapshot out of this.

81
00:04:07.06 --> 00:04:10.07
So Actions, Create Snapshot.

82
00:04:10.07 --> 00:04:12.05
Notice what happens over here.

83
00:04:12.05 --> 00:04:15.01
It automatically turns on encryption

84
00:04:15.01 --> 00:04:18.08
and we do not have the option
to turn off encryption.

85
00:04:18.08 --> 00:04:19.09
Let's give it a name.

86
00:04:19.09 --> 00:04:22.08
Let's call it as Encrypted Snap.

87
00:04:22.08 --> 00:04:25.00
Click on Create.

88
00:04:25.00 --> 00:04:28.03
And click on Close and go
back to Snapshots over here.

89
00:04:28.03 --> 00:04:32.05
So this is the snapshot that
is being created right now.

90
00:04:32.05 --> 00:04:34.09
The snapshot creation has completed.

91
00:04:34.09 --> 00:04:37.07
Let's try to create a volume out of it.

92
00:04:37.07 --> 00:04:40.06
So Actions, Create Volume.

93
00:04:40.06 --> 00:04:42.03
I want you to notice this guys.

94
00:04:42.03 --> 00:04:45.02
There is no way to turn that off.

95
00:04:45.02 --> 00:04:48.04
The volume will also be encrypted.

96
00:04:48.04 --> 00:04:51.02
This is very, very important
for us to understand,

97
00:04:51.02 --> 00:04:54.05
that once your original
volume has been encrypted,

98
00:04:54.05 --> 00:04:56.02
the snapshot will be encrypted

99
00:04:56.02 --> 00:04:58.08
and the volume that is
created out of that snapshot

100
00:04:58.08 --> 00:05:00.04
will also be encrypted.

101
00:05:00.04 --> 00:05:05.00
You don't have the option to turn it off.

102
00:05:05.00 --> 00:05:06.06
Let's cancel out of here.

103
00:05:06.06 --> 00:05:09.02
And let me show you
how to copy a snapshot.

104
00:05:09.02 --> 00:05:10.08
So you can select your snapshot.

105
00:05:10.08 --> 00:05:14.09
You can go to Actions,
and we can say Copy.

106
00:05:14.09 --> 00:05:16.06
When you select Copy, you have

107
00:05:16.06 --> 00:05:19.07
the option to change the region.

108
00:05:19.07 --> 00:05:22.06
So, for example, if I
wanted to move this over to,

109
00:05:22.06 --> 00:05:25.07
let's say, Mumbai, I can select that.

110
00:05:25.07 --> 00:05:27.08
I can give it a nice description

111
00:05:27.08 --> 00:05:30.06
and here, I have the
option to change the key.

112
00:05:30.06 --> 00:05:32.07
So when you're moving across the region,

113
00:05:32.07 --> 00:05:34.08
you have the option to select your key.

114
00:05:34.08 --> 00:05:38.02
And this key is what I
have in the Mumbai region.

115
00:05:38.02 --> 00:05:40.03
So I can select my key over here.

116
00:05:40.03 --> 00:05:43.00
Well let me do this, let
me select the other one.

117
00:05:43.00 --> 00:05:45.02
We can say Copy.

118
00:05:45.02 --> 00:05:49.03
So now, it is being moved
over to the Mumbai region.

119
00:05:49.03 --> 00:05:52.07
So I'm gonna close this and
go back to Mumbai over here.

120
00:05:52.07 --> 00:05:55.09
Cancel out of here, go to Snapshots

121
00:05:55.09 --> 00:06:00.05
and you can see that the snapshot
creation has now started.

122
00:06:00.05 --> 00:06:03.05
So, in this way, we can create
snapshots out of volumes

123
00:06:03.05 --> 00:06:05.07
and we can move them across.

124
00:06:05.07 --> 00:06:07.08
In the last video, we understood that

125
00:06:07.08 --> 00:06:11.07
snapshots are actually
stored in Amazon S3.

126
00:06:11.07 --> 00:06:15.02
However, if you visited the AWS S3 console

127
00:06:15.02 --> 00:06:18.01
you would not find your
snapshots over there.

128
00:06:18.01 --> 00:06:19.09
In fact, we can take a look at it.

129
00:06:19.09 --> 00:06:23.02
I'll go to Services, and I'll open up S3

130
00:06:23.02 --> 00:06:25.04
in a new tab over here.

131
00:06:25.04 --> 00:06:26.05
And you can see over here,

132
00:06:26.05 --> 00:06:31.00
I do not have any bucket where
my snapshots are created.

133
00:06:31.00 --> 00:06:34.01
In fact, these are all my
existing and old buckets.

134
00:06:34.01 --> 00:06:37.02
There's no new bucket that
contains the snapshots.

135
00:06:37.02 --> 00:06:40.07
So, even though snapshots
are stored in Amazon S3,

136
00:06:40.07 --> 00:06:43.07
you don't see them from the S3 console.

137
00:06:43.07 --> 00:06:48.05
You can only see them
from the AWS EC2 console.

138
00:06:48.05 --> 00:06:51.01
And, by the way, I just
noticed that it says, error.

139
00:06:51.01 --> 00:06:53.02
I have no idea why that has happened.

140
00:06:53.02 --> 00:06:55.04
Let's do a refresh.

141
00:06:55.04 --> 00:06:56.05
Now it says pending.

142
00:06:56.05 --> 00:06:59.02
So probably it should now complete.

143
00:06:59.02 --> 00:07:01.05
So that's about EBS snapshots.

144
00:07:01.05 --> 00:07:03.00
I'd like to thank you for watching.

145
00:07:03.00 --> 00:07:04.08
And I'll catch you in the next video.

146
00:07:04.08 --> 00:07:05.06
Thank you.
