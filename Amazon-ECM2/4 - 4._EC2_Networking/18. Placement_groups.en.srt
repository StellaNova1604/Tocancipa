00:00:00.03 --> 00:00:02.07
- [Instructor] Welcome back, in this video

2
00:00:02.07 --> 00:00:07.08
we're gonna talk about
placement groups, let's begin.

3
00:00:07.08 --> 00:00:10.06
All right, so what do we
mean by a placement group?

4
00:00:10.06 --> 00:00:13.05
Well, before I take you into
the technical definition

5
00:00:13.05 --> 00:00:16.02
of what a placement group
is, I'm gonna put it

6
00:00:16.02 --> 00:00:19.00
to you in really simple words.

7
00:00:19.00 --> 00:00:21.05
In simple words, a placement group is

8
00:00:21.05 --> 00:00:26.01
just a logical grouping
of your EC2 instances, it

9
00:00:26.01 --> 00:00:31.00
just defines how your EC2
instances are logically grouped.

10
00:00:31.00 --> 00:00:33.01
There are two different
types of groupings,

11
00:00:33.01 --> 00:00:36.00
essentially two different
types of placement groups.

12
00:00:36.00 --> 00:00:39.08
Each of them has a certain way
of grouping the EC2 instances

13
00:00:39.08 --> 00:00:42.09
and gives a different output, right?

14
00:00:42.09 --> 00:00:45.04
But in simple words, a placement group is

15
00:00:45.04 --> 00:00:49.07
just a logical grouping
of your EC2 instances.

16
00:00:49.07 --> 00:00:52.07
Now let's look at the
technical definition.

17
00:00:52.07 --> 00:00:57.00
So launching instances in a
placement group determines

18
00:00:57.00 --> 00:01:02.03
how instances are placed
on the underlying hardware.

19
00:01:02.03 --> 00:01:05.08
There are two strategies for
creating a placement group.

20
00:01:05.08 --> 00:01:08.05
The first one is called -s cluster.

21
00:01:08.05 --> 00:01:12.04
It clusters your instances
into a low-latency group

22
00:01:12.04 --> 00:01:15.06
within a single Availability Zone.

23
00:01:15.06 --> 00:01:17.08
That's the limitation for cluster.

24
00:01:17.08 --> 00:01:19.09
Your instances have to be grouped

25
00:01:19.09 --> 00:01:23.01
within a single Availability Zone.

26
00:01:23.01 --> 00:01:26.00
If you choose the spread
strategy, it spreads

27
00:01:26.00 --> 00:01:30.09
your instances across
distinct underlying hardware.

28
00:01:30.09 --> 00:01:33.01
The interesting part is there is no charge

29
00:01:33.01 --> 00:01:37.00
for creating a placement group.

30
00:01:37.00 --> 00:01:40.04
Let's talk a little bit more
about cluster placement groups.

31
00:01:40.04 --> 00:01:43.01
A cluster placement group
is a logical grouping

32
00:01:43.01 --> 00:01:47.08
of your instances within a
single Availability Zone.

33
00:01:47.08 --> 00:01:50.07
Placement groups are
recommended for applications

34
00:01:50.07 --> 00:01:53.06
that benefit from low network latency,

35
00:01:53.06 --> 00:01:56.08
high network throughput, or both.

36
00:01:56.08 --> 00:02:00.04
A good example for this would
be stock market applications,

37
00:02:00.04 --> 00:02:03.06
where your stock prices
keep changing all the time,

38
00:02:03.06 --> 00:02:06.04
in fact, almost every second.

39
00:02:06.04 --> 00:02:08.01
That's a classic example of where

40
00:02:08.01 --> 00:02:11.06
you might want to use a placement group.

41
00:02:11.06 --> 00:02:14.04
A cluster placement group cannot span

42
00:02:14.04 --> 00:02:18.04
multiple Availability Zones.

43
00:02:18.04 --> 00:02:20.07
It is recommended to
launch the required number

44
00:02:20.07 --> 00:02:24.03
of instances in a single launch request

45
00:02:24.03 --> 00:02:27.03
and also to use the same instance type

46
00:02:27.03 --> 00:02:31.01
for all instances in a
cluster placement group.

47
00:02:31.01 --> 00:02:33.07
Essentially, what it is trying to say is,

48
00:02:33.07 --> 00:02:36.03
let's say you want to have three instances

49
00:02:36.03 --> 00:02:39.04
in a placement group, it is best to launch

50
00:02:39.04 --> 00:02:43.06
all three instances
within a single request.

51
00:02:43.06 --> 00:02:46.07
What happens is, let's say
you launch two instances first

52
00:02:46.07 --> 00:02:48.07
into a placement group and you try

53
00:02:48.07 --> 00:02:51.08
to add one more instance,
there are chances

54
00:02:51.08 --> 00:02:55.06
that you might receive an
insufficient capacity error.

55
00:02:55.06 --> 00:02:58.04
To avoid this, it is
recommended that you launch

56
00:02:58.04 --> 00:03:02.04
all required instances with
a single launch request, and

57
00:03:02.04 --> 00:03:06.04
it is also recommended that
you use the same instance type.

58
00:03:06.04 --> 00:03:08.08
Maybe all three of them are m4.large,

59
00:03:08.08 --> 00:03:11.06
or maybe all three of them
are some other instance type.

60
00:03:11.06 --> 00:03:15.06
Essentially, they are all
the same instance type.

61
00:03:15.06 --> 00:03:18.09
The maximum network throughput
between two instances

62
00:03:18.09 --> 00:03:21.06
in a cluster placement group is limited

63
00:03:21.06 --> 00:03:24.08
by the slower of the two instances.

64
00:03:24.08 --> 00:03:28.02
For applications with high
throughput requirements,

65
00:03:28.02 --> 00:03:31.05
choose an instance type with 10-Gbps

66
00:03:31.05 --> 00:03:34.07
or 25-Gbps network connectivity.

67
00:03:34.07 --> 00:03:36.09
And I'll show you exactly
how you can find out

68
00:03:36.09 --> 00:03:39.09
what is the throughput
of your EC2 instance.

69
00:03:39.09 --> 00:03:42.00
So let's say I'm launching two instances

70
00:03:42.00 --> 00:03:44.04
within a cluster placement group.

71
00:03:44.04 --> 00:03:47.03
One of them has 10-Gbps capacity

72
00:03:47.03 --> 00:03:50.09
and the other one has 25-Gbps capacity.

73
00:03:50.09 --> 00:03:52.04
What's gonna be the network throughput

74
00:03:52.04 --> 00:03:54.05
between both these instances?

75
00:03:54.05 --> 00:03:57.03
It is equal to the slower
of the two instances.

76
00:03:57.03 --> 00:04:00.04
In this case, the slower one is 10-Gbps

77
00:04:00.04 --> 00:04:05.07
and that will be the throughput
between both the instances.

78
00:04:05.07 --> 00:04:09.00
All right, now let's talk
about spread placement groups.

79
00:04:09.00 --> 00:04:11.08
A spread placement group
is a group of instances

80
00:04:11.08 --> 00:04:16.09
that are each placed on
distinct underlying hardware.

81
00:04:16.09 --> 00:04:20.03
So if you choose the option
called spread placement group,

82
00:04:20.03 --> 00:04:24.02
all your instances of the
placement group will be placed

83
00:04:24.02 --> 00:04:26.09
on distinct underlying hardware,

84
00:04:26.09 --> 00:04:28.09
which means the physical servers on

85
00:04:28.09 --> 00:04:34.01
which the instances are created
will be totally different.

86
00:04:34.01 --> 00:04:37.01
Launching instances in
a spread placement group

87
00:04:37.01 --> 00:04:41.01
reduces the risk of simultaneous
failures that might occur

88
00:04:41.01 --> 00:04:44.08
when instances share the
same underlying hardware.

89
00:04:44.08 --> 00:04:47.07
Imagine this, you had three EC2 instances

90
00:04:47.07 --> 00:04:50.08
within a placement group and
all the three instances are

91
00:04:50.08 --> 00:04:53.01
on the same underlying hardware.

92
00:04:53.01 --> 00:04:55.01
So if the underlying hardware fails,

93
00:04:55.01 --> 00:04:57.09
all your instances fail,
but that does not happen

94
00:04:57.09 --> 00:05:00.04
with spread placement groups.

95
00:05:00.04 --> 00:05:03.04
All your instances will
be on separate physical

96
00:05:03.04 --> 00:05:06.02
underlying hardware,
which means even if one

97
00:05:06.02 --> 00:05:09.06
of the hardware goes down,
it's just one of the instances

98
00:05:09.06 --> 00:05:12.07
in that placement group
that will be affected.

99
00:05:12.07 --> 00:05:15.08
The remaining will be just fine.

100
00:05:15.08 --> 00:05:17.09
Spread placement groups are suitable

101
00:05:17.09 --> 00:05:22.09
for mixing instance types or
launching instances over time.

102
00:05:22.09 --> 00:05:26.03
This was a limitation with
cluster placement groups.

103
00:05:26.03 --> 00:05:29.00
With cluster placement
groups, the recommendation was

104
00:05:29.00 --> 00:05:31.07
that you should launch
all of them together

105
00:05:31.07 --> 00:05:34.04
and you should have
the same instance type.

106
00:05:34.04 --> 00:05:38.02
Over here, that's not the case.

107
00:05:38.02 --> 00:05:41.05
Spread placement groups are
recommended for applications

108
00:05:41.05 --> 00:05:44.02
that have a small number
of critical instances

109
00:05:44.02 --> 00:05:48.05
that should be kept
separate from each other.

110
00:05:48.05 --> 00:05:50.04
A spread placement group can span

111
00:05:50.04 --> 00:05:53.05
multiple Availability Zones
and you can have a max

112
00:05:53.05 --> 00:06:00.01
of seven running instances per
Availability Zone per group.

113
00:06:00.01 --> 00:06:03.03
Let's now talk about some
rules for placement groups.

114
00:06:03.03 --> 00:06:05.03
Number one, the name you specify

115
00:06:05.03 --> 00:06:07.09
for a placement group must be unique

116
00:06:07.09 --> 00:06:11.06
within your AWS account for that region.

117
00:06:11.06 --> 00:06:14.02
Not all instance types are
available for launching

118
00:06:14.02 --> 00:06:16.08
into a placement group,
and I will talk about

119
00:06:16.08 --> 00:06:19.02
which of those are not supported.

120
00:06:19.02 --> 00:06:22.02
Placement groups cannot
be merged, for example,

121
00:06:22.02 --> 00:06:25.05
let's say I have one placement
group of two instances

122
00:06:25.05 --> 00:06:28.02
and another placement
group of three instances.

123
00:06:28.02 --> 00:06:32.03
If I wanted to merge all of
them to make five instances

124
00:06:32.03 --> 00:06:35.08
within one placement group,
that would not be possible.

125
00:06:35.08 --> 00:06:38.03
If I had to bring all the five instances

126
00:06:38.03 --> 00:06:40.08
into the same placement group,

127
00:06:40.08 --> 00:06:42.09
I can shut down the two instances

128
00:06:42.09 --> 00:06:44.08
which are in the same placement group,

129
00:06:44.08 --> 00:06:50.05
and launch in the other one
which has three instances.

130
00:06:50.05 --> 00:06:53.01
An instance can be launched
into one placement group

131
00:06:53.01 --> 00:06:58.03
at a time, it cannot span
multiple placement groups.

132
00:06:58.03 --> 00:07:00.03
All right, having understood the concepts,

133
00:07:00.03 --> 00:07:04.09
let's look at some of this in action.

134
00:07:04.09 --> 00:07:07.02
All right, so I'm here at the AWS console

135
00:07:07.02 --> 00:07:10.05
and I'm first gonna navigate into EC2.

136
00:07:10.05 --> 00:07:13.05
Before we launch an instance
into a placement group,

137
00:07:13.05 --> 00:07:16.00
we must first create a placement group,

138
00:07:16.00 --> 00:07:20.01
and we can do that from
here, Placement Groups.

139
00:07:20.01 --> 00:07:22.05
Right now, I do not
have a placement group.

140
00:07:22.05 --> 00:07:25.05
I'm gonna start by creating
one, Create Placement Group.

141
00:07:25.05 --> 00:07:30.05
And I'm gonna call it as MyPlacementGroup,

142
00:07:30.05 --> 00:07:33.05
and I'm gonna choose
the strategy as Cluster.

143
00:07:33.05 --> 00:07:36.05
We understood that when you
choose the cluster strategy,

144
00:07:36.05 --> 00:07:38.00
all of your instances have to be

145
00:07:38.00 --> 00:07:40.09
within the same Availability Zone.

146
00:07:40.09 --> 00:07:44.03
I'm gonna click on Create, and that's it.

147
00:07:44.03 --> 00:07:46.00
Now when you launch the instance,

148
00:07:46.00 --> 00:07:48.04
when you go back to Instances over here,

149
00:07:48.04 --> 00:07:50.06
I'm going to click on Launch Instance

150
00:07:50.06 --> 00:07:54.07
and I'm gonna select Amazon Linux AMI.

151
00:07:54.07 --> 00:07:57.08
Now here is where you can
see your network performance.

152
00:07:57.08 --> 00:08:00.00
So you can see that some of them support

153
00:08:00.00 --> 00:08:06.08
up to 10 Gbps, while some of
them support up to 25 Gbps.

154
00:08:06.08 --> 00:08:09.00
So you can see that over here.

155
00:08:09.00 --> 00:08:12.00
Now, not all of your
instance types are available

156
00:08:12.00 --> 00:08:14.02
for launching into placement groups.

157
00:08:14.02 --> 00:08:19.01
For example, if I tried
t2.micro and click on Next,

158
00:08:19.01 --> 00:08:22.01
ideally you should get
that option over here.

159
00:08:22.01 --> 00:08:23.08
But I do not have that option,

160
00:08:23.08 --> 00:08:28.01
because t2.micro cannot be
launched into a placement group.

161
00:08:28.01 --> 00:08:30.01
So I'm gonna show you a document

162
00:08:30.01 --> 00:08:32.09
which shows what are the instance types

163
00:08:32.09 --> 00:08:37.03
which are allowed for placement groups.

164
00:08:37.03 --> 00:08:38.07
All right, so this is the document

165
00:08:38.07 --> 00:08:40.03
and I'm gonna be leaving a link

166
00:08:40.03 --> 00:08:43.01
to this document in the resources section.

167
00:08:43.01 --> 00:08:46.07
Over here, we can see that these
are the only instance types

168
00:08:46.07 --> 00:08:49.04
that can be launched
into a placement group.

169
00:08:49.04 --> 00:08:51.09
And we can see that, in general purpose,

170
00:08:51.09 --> 00:08:54.08
we do not have the t2 instance class,

171
00:08:54.08 --> 00:08:57.03
which is why we cannot use that.

172
00:08:57.03 --> 00:09:01.07
So if we wanted to try it, we
could probably try m4.large.

173
00:09:01.07 --> 00:09:05.08
So let's go back to the console

174
00:09:05.08 --> 00:09:08.06
and let's go back over here.

175
00:09:08.06 --> 00:09:12.01
Let's say Launch Instance,
Amazon Linux AMI,

176
00:09:12.01 --> 00:09:17.00
and this time I'm gonna go with m4.large.

177
00:09:17.00 --> 00:09:20.02
Click on Next, and over
here we have the option

178
00:09:20.02 --> 00:09:23.05
that says Add instance to placement group.

179
00:09:23.05 --> 00:09:26.01
We can select an existing placement group.

180
00:09:26.01 --> 00:09:28.00
This is the one that we created.

181
00:09:28.00 --> 00:09:33.05
Or we could also create
a new placement group.

182
00:09:33.05 --> 00:09:35.09
So that's the concept of placement groups.

183
00:09:35.09 --> 00:09:37.02
What's the bottom line?

184
00:09:37.02 --> 00:09:39.06
The bottom line is that
placement groups are

185
00:09:39.06 --> 00:09:43.02
just a logical grouping
of your EC2 instances.

186
00:09:43.02 --> 00:09:45.03
There are two strategies
that you can follow,

187
00:09:45.03 --> 00:09:49.08
cluster and spread, each of
them has different features.

188
00:09:49.08 --> 00:09:52.00
Why would you want to
put your EC2 instances

189
00:09:52.00 --> 00:09:53.06
into a placement group?

190
00:09:53.06 --> 00:09:56.09
Well, by doing that you
get high network throughput

191
00:09:56.09 --> 00:09:59.07
and low network latency.

192
00:09:59.07 --> 00:10:01.00
That's about placement groups.

193
00:10:01.00 --> 00:10:02.06
I'd like to thank you for watching,

194
00:10:02.06 --> 00:10:05.00
and I'll catch you in the
next video, thank you.
