00:00:00.04 --> 00:00:01.07
- [Instructor] Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.07 --> 00:00:06.06
In this video, we'll talk
about EC2 instance lifecycle.

3
00:00:06.06 --> 00:00:09.06
Let's begin.

4
00:00:09.06 --> 00:00:13.09
An EC2 instance has several
stages as part of the lifecycle.

5
00:00:13.09 --> 00:00:17.06
And the first stage is
known as instance launch.

6
00:00:17.06 --> 00:00:22.00
When an EC2 instance is launched,
it enters the first state,

7
00:00:22.00 --> 00:00:25.02
which is called as the pending state.

8
00:00:25.02 --> 00:00:28.05
The instance type that you
specified at launch time

9
00:00:28.05 --> 00:00:31.02
determines the hardware
of the host computer

10
00:00:31.02 --> 00:00:33.00
for your instance.

11
00:00:33.00 --> 00:00:34.09
Essentially, what it is saying is,

12
00:00:34.09 --> 00:00:38.08
depending on the instance
type, and the instance size,

13
00:00:38.08 --> 00:00:41.03
the hardware of the
underlying physical computer

14
00:00:41.03 --> 00:00:43.04
will be determined.

15
00:00:43.04 --> 00:00:47.08
Once the instance is ready,
it enters the running state.

16
00:00:47.08 --> 00:00:50.05
When the instance enters
the running state,

17
00:00:50.05 --> 00:00:54.06
you are billed for every second,
with a one-minute minimum,

18
00:00:54.06 --> 00:00:56.06
that you keep the instance running,

19
00:00:56.06 --> 00:00:58.08
even if the instance remains idle

20
00:00:58.08 --> 00:01:01.01
and you do not connect to it.

21
00:01:01.01 --> 00:01:03.00
This is very important to understand.

22
00:01:03.00 --> 00:01:06.07
The minimum billing cycle for
an EC2 instance is one minute

23
00:01:06.07 --> 00:01:08.06
and after your one minute is over,

24
00:01:08.06 --> 00:01:10.09
it's a per-second billing.

25
00:01:10.09 --> 00:01:14.01
Even if you do not use it, even
if you do not connect to it,

26
00:01:14.01 --> 00:01:18.02
you're certainly gonna
get charged for that.

27
00:01:18.02 --> 00:01:20.06
Next is instance start and stop.

28
00:01:20.06 --> 00:01:24.05
When you stop your instance,
it enters the stopping state

29
00:01:24.05 --> 00:01:27.05
and then it enters the stopped state.

30
00:01:27.05 --> 00:01:30.04
Instance usage or data transfer fees,

31
00:01:30.04 --> 00:01:33.09
are not charged after
the instance has stopped.

32
00:01:33.09 --> 00:01:38.08
However, storage costs for
EBS volumes are applied.

33
00:01:38.08 --> 00:01:41.04
When the instance is in the stopped state,

34
00:01:41.04 --> 00:01:46.08
certain attributes, such as
instance type, can be modified.

35
00:01:46.08 --> 00:01:48.07
When the instance is started,

36
00:01:48.07 --> 00:01:50.09
it, again, enters the pending state

37
00:01:50.09 --> 00:01:55.05
and the instance may have been
moved to a new host computer,

38
00:01:55.05 --> 00:01:58.00
which means, when you
stop your EC2 instance

39
00:01:58.00 --> 00:02:01.04
and when you start it again,
the instance may have moved

40
00:02:01.04 --> 00:02:05.00
to a different physical host.

41
00:02:05.00 --> 00:02:08.06
If your instance is running in EC2-VPC,

42
00:02:08.06 --> 00:02:12.03
it retains its private IPv4 address

43
00:02:12.03 --> 00:02:16.03
and IPv6 address, if it had one.

44
00:02:16.03 --> 00:02:18.04
What is EC2-VPC?

45
00:02:18.04 --> 00:02:24.00
Well, all the new AWS accounts
have the concept of VPC.

46
00:02:24.00 --> 00:02:27.05
Longtime back or, maybe a few years back,

47
00:02:27.05 --> 00:02:31.05
AWS did not have the concept of VPC.

48
00:02:31.05 --> 00:02:34.08
Those accounts are called as EC2-Classic.

49
00:02:34.08 --> 00:02:38.05
But all accounts which
have the concept of a VPC

50
00:02:38.05 --> 00:02:41.00
are called as EC2-VPC.

51
00:02:41.00 --> 00:02:45.08
Most likely, the account that
you're using is also EC2-VPC.

52
00:02:45.08 --> 00:02:49.07
So, if your instance
is running in EC2-VPC,

53
00:02:49.07 --> 00:02:54.03
it will retain its private
IPv4 and IPv6 address

54
00:02:54.03 --> 00:02:59.02
when you stop and start it.

55
00:02:59.02 --> 00:03:00.08
Instance reboot.

56
00:03:00.08 --> 00:03:02.07
When an instance is rebooted,

57
00:03:02.07 --> 00:03:06.02
it remains on the same host computer.

58
00:03:06.02 --> 00:03:11.05
It also maintains its public
DNS name, private IP address,

59
00:03:11.05 --> 00:03:16.02
and any data on its
instance store volumes.

60
00:03:16.02 --> 00:03:17.06
In one of the earlier lectures,

61
00:03:17.06 --> 00:03:20.01
when we spoke about
instance store volumes,

62
00:03:20.01 --> 00:03:22.03
we understood that instance store volumes

63
00:03:22.03 --> 00:03:24.07
are used for temporary storage.

64
00:03:24.07 --> 00:03:28.03
You will lose your data if
your instance has been stopped,

65
00:03:28.03 --> 00:03:33.02
it has been terminated or if
the underlying hardware fails.

66
00:03:33.02 --> 00:03:34.07
And we also understood that,

67
00:03:34.07 --> 00:03:37.03
if your EC2 instance is rebooted,

68
00:03:37.03 --> 00:03:41.03
the data in the instance
store volume will persist.

69
00:03:41.03 --> 00:03:43.06
Rebooting an instance does not start

70
00:03:43.06 --> 00:03:46.00
a new instance billing period.

71
00:03:46.00 --> 00:03:47.06
Per-second billing continues

72
00:03:47.06 --> 00:03:54.00
without a further
one-minute minimum charge.

73
00:03:54.00 --> 00:03:57.03
Let's talk about instance retirement.

74
00:03:57.03 --> 00:03:59.09
An instance is scheduled to be retired

75
00:03:59.09 --> 00:04:03.08
when AWS detects a failure
on the underlying hardware

76
00:04:03.08 --> 00:04:06.01
that cannot be repaired.

77
00:04:06.01 --> 00:04:08.08
If your instance is
scheduled for retirement,

78
00:04:08.08 --> 00:04:11.06
you will receive an
email prior to the event

79
00:04:11.06 --> 00:04:15.06
with the instance ID
and the retirement date.

80
00:04:15.06 --> 00:04:18.08
When an instance reaches its
scheduled retirement date,

81
00:04:18.08 --> 00:04:22.09
it is stopped or terminated by AWS.

82
00:04:22.09 --> 00:04:27.01
If your instance root device
is an Amazon EBS volume,

83
00:04:27.01 --> 00:04:28.08
the instance is stopped

84
00:04:28.08 --> 00:04:32.04
and you can start it again at anytime.

85
00:04:32.04 --> 00:04:34.07
However, if your instance root device

86
00:04:34.07 --> 00:04:38.09
is an instance store volume,
the instance is terminated

87
00:04:38.09 --> 00:04:42.07
and cannot be used again.

88
00:04:42.07 --> 00:04:45.00
I'm gonna take you to the AWS console

89
00:04:45.00 --> 00:04:48.06
and show you exactly where
you get that notification.

90
00:04:48.06 --> 00:04:51.00
And back over here to the AWS console

91
00:04:51.00 --> 00:04:54.01
and I'm gonna navigate
to the EC2 dashboard.

92
00:04:54.01 --> 00:04:57.00
If your instance is
scheduled for retirement,

93
00:04:57.00 --> 00:05:00.05
you will see that over here
in the Scheduled Events.

94
00:05:00.05 --> 00:05:03.04
This is the place where
they'll send you a notification

95
00:05:03.04 --> 00:05:06.02
that your instance is about to be retired.

96
00:05:06.02 --> 00:05:08.07
Of course, they will
also send you an email

97
00:05:08.07 --> 00:05:11.08
with the instance ID
and the retirement date.

98
00:05:11.08 --> 00:05:17.06
And you can also see it
on the console over here.

99
00:05:17.06 --> 00:05:21.04
Back over here, let's talk
about instance termination.

100
00:05:21.04 --> 00:05:23.05
When the instance is terminated,

101
00:05:23.05 --> 00:05:27.05
the status changes to
shutting down or terminated

102
00:05:27.05 --> 00:05:31.02
and you stop incurring
charges for that instance.

103
00:05:31.02 --> 00:05:33.03
After the instance is terminated,

104
00:05:33.03 --> 00:05:36.06
it remains visible in the
console for a short while

105
00:05:36.06 --> 00:05:40.02
and then the entry's
automatically deleted.

106
00:05:40.02 --> 00:05:44.00
Terminated instances cannot be recovered.

107
00:05:44.00 --> 00:05:46.07
Well, that's about the
EC2 instance lifecycle.

108
00:05:46.07 --> 00:05:48.03
I'd like to thank you for watching

109
00:05:48.03 --> 00:05:49.09
and I'll catch you in the next video.

110
00:05:49.09 --> 00:05:50.07
Thank you.
