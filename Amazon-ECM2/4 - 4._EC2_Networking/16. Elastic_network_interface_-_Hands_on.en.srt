1
00:00:04.00 --> 00:00:04.09
- All right.

2
00:00:04.09 --> 00:00:07.05
So I'm here at the AWS EC2 console,

3
00:00:07.05 --> 00:00:10.04
and let's start by
launching an EC2 instance.

4
00:00:10.04 --> 00:00:12.05
So we'll click on Launch Instance.

5
00:00:12.05 --> 00:00:13.08
I'm gonna select the first one,

6
00:00:13.08 --> 00:00:17.01
which is Amazon Linux AMI.

7
00:00:17.01 --> 00:00:21.08
And I'm gonna select
t2.micro, for this one.

8
00:00:21.08 --> 00:00:24.08
Now, over here, you'll notice that,

9
00:00:24.08 --> 00:00:27.01
after this option, which is t2.unlimited,

10
00:00:27.01 --> 00:00:30.09
we only have the option
to add the user data.

11
00:00:30.09 --> 00:00:33.03
But as soon as I change
the subnet, over here,

12
00:00:33.03 --> 00:00:36.00
if I choose a specific subnet,

13
00:00:36.00 --> 00:00:37.07
you'll notice that now I have the option

14
00:00:37.07 --> 00:00:41.02
to add additional network interfaces.

15
00:00:41.02 --> 00:00:46.01
By default, it takes eth0,
which is the default interface,

16
00:00:46.01 --> 00:00:47.09
but if I wanted to add one more,

17
00:00:47.09 --> 00:00:49.06
I can say Add Device, and

18
00:00:49.06 --> 00:00:53.01
we can add one more interface, right?

19
00:00:53.01 --> 00:00:54.09
So this option is available only if

20
00:00:54.09 --> 00:00:57.08
you select the subnet, over here.

21
00:00:57.08 --> 00:01:00.09
Even if we do not add
additional interfaces over here,

22
00:01:00.09 --> 00:01:03.04
we have the option to add it later on.

23
00:01:03.04 --> 00:01:07.00
So we'll leave it at the
default, and we'll continue.

24
00:01:07.00 --> 00:01:09.00
Storage of eight gigs is fine.

25
00:01:09.00 --> 00:01:11.02
We can add some tags, if required.

26
00:01:11.02 --> 00:01:12.09
I'm not doing that right now.

27
00:01:12.09 --> 00:01:16.09
I'm gonna select a security group.

28
00:01:16.09 --> 00:01:18.07
Review and Launch, Launch,

29
00:01:18.07 --> 00:01:22.03
and I'll acknowledge that I
have access to that key pair.

30
00:01:22.03 --> 00:01:25.07
Now, the instance is getting provisioned.

31
00:01:25.07 --> 00:01:30.01
I'm gonna click on this one
and refresh a couple of times.

32
00:01:30.01 --> 00:01:31.05
Meanwhile, we can notice, over here,

33
00:01:31.05 --> 00:01:35.01
that we already have
an IP address assigned,

34
00:01:35.01 --> 00:01:38.04
so we can see that we have
a public IPv4 address,

35
00:01:38.04 --> 00:01:41.08
and we also have a private IPv4 address.

36
00:01:41.08 --> 00:01:46.03
Notice that I have not
received an IPv6 address.

37
00:01:46.03 --> 00:01:50.05
And if I scroll down, I
have one network interface.

38
00:01:50.05 --> 00:01:54.01
If I click on that interface,
I can see the interface ID,

39
00:01:54.01 --> 00:01:59.00
the VPC ID, it says the
attachment status is "attaching".

40
00:01:59.00 --> 00:02:02.04
In fact, if I refresh
this, it's now running.

41
00:02:02.04 --> 00:02:04.00
Let's try that again.

42
00:02:04.00 --> 00:02:07.06
So now it says it is
attached, the attachment date,

43
00:02:07.06 --> 00:02:11.00
the attachment time, private IPv4 address,

44
00:02:11.00 --> 00:02:13.08
public IPv4 address,
and the security group

45
00:02:13.08 --> 00:02:16.07
that has been associated.

46
00:02:16.07 --> 00:02:18.06
Now, I'm gonna click
on this one, over here,

47
00:02:18.06 --> 00:02:21.05
the interface ID, and when I do that,

48
00:02:21.05 --> 00:02:23.02
it moves me to this tab, over here,

49
00:02:23.02 --> 00:02:26.06
which is call as Network Interfaces.

50
00:02:26.06 --> 00:02:28.05
This is the interface, and we can see

51
00:02:28.05 --> 00:02:31.09
that the status is "in-use".

52
00:02:31.09 --> 00:02:35.02
Now, let's try to add
one more IPv4 address

53
00:02:35.02 --> 00:02:36.07
to the same interface.

54
00:02:36.07 --> 00:02:40.01
So you go to Actions, Manage IP Addresses,

55
00:02:40.01 --> 00:02:43.03
and we can say Assign new IP.

56
00:02:43.03 --> 00:02:46.02
At this point, you could
type in an IP address

57
00:02:46.02 --> 00:02:49.06
from that subnet, or
you can say Auto-assign,

58
00:02:49.06 --> 00:02:50.05
which means it will

59
00:02:50.05 --> 00:02:53.06
automatically allocate
an available address,

60
00:02:53.06 --> 00:02:56.02
like what we see on the screen, right now.

61
00:02:56.02 --> 00:03:00.00
Now, if I close this, and if
I just come down, over here,

62
00:03:00.00 --> 00:03:03.00
we can see that we have
two private IP addresses,

63
00:03:03.00 --> 00:03:05.04
one over here, and one over here,

64
00:03:05.04 --> 00:03:08.06
both assigned to the same interface.

65
00:03:08.06 --> 00:03:11.05
If I go back to Instances, over here,

66
00:03:11.05 --> 00:03:13.09
I select a running
instance, we can see that

67
00:03:13.09 --> 00:03:16.08
we have a private IPv4 address,

68
00:03:16.08 --> 00:03:19.01
which is the primary
one, and we also have a

69
00:03:19.01 --> 00:03:23.04
secondary private IPv4 address.

70
00:03:23.04 --> 00:03:26.06
So that means you can have
multiple addresses assigned

71
00:03:26.06 --> 00:03:29.07
to the same interface.

72
00:03:29.07 --> 00:03:31.07
Now, let's change things a little bit.

73
00:03:31.07 --> 00:03:35.04
So we'll go back to Network
Interfaces, all right?

74
00:03:35.04 --> 00:03:39.00
So over here, I notice that
there's a couple of interfaces,

75
00:03:39.00 --> 00:03:40.06
and one of them is available.

76
00:03:40.06 --> 00:03:42.03
I did not create that, right now.

77
00:03:42.03 --> 00:03:45.07
I believe this is from earlier.

78
00:03:45.07 --> 00:03:49.08
I did not do it right now, so
I'm just gonna delete that.

79
00:03:49.08 --> 00:03:52.01
Okay, so we are left
with the one interface.

80
00:03:52.01 --> 00:03:54.02
If we did Manage IP Addresses,

81
00:03:54.02 --> 00:03:56.07
we notice both the IP addresses.

82
00:03:56.07 --> 00:04:00.02
I'm gonna remove this one,
Unassign, Yes, Update.

83
00:04:00.02 --> 00:04:03.04
Now, we only have one
private IPv4 address,

84
00:04:03.04 --> 00:04:07.02
which is mapped to a public IPv4 address.

85
00:04:07.02 --> 00:04:09.07
Let's try to create one more interface.

86
00:04:09.07 --> 00:04:13.00
So you go to Actions, or rather,

87
00:04:13.00 --> 00:04:15.06
we go to Create Network Interface.

88
00:04:15.06 --> 00:04:17.04
We need to select a subnet.

89
00:04:17.04 --> 00:04:19.02
I'm gonna select the same subnet

90
00:04:19.02 --> 00:04:21.08
in which my EC2 instance is present,

91
00:04:21.08 --> 00:04:24.06
which is ap-south-1a.

92
00:04:24.06 --> 00:04:27.01
We can hard-code a private IPv4 address,

93
00:04:27.01 --> 00:04:29.07
or we can say Auto-assign, and then

94
00:04:29.07 --> 00:04:32.08
we must select a security group.

95
00:04:32.08 --> 00:04:35.09
This brings us to a
critical understanding.

96
00:04:35.09 --> 00:04:38.04
All along, we've been talking
about security groups,

97
00:04:38.04 --> 00:04:39.09
and we've been saying that

98
00:04:39.09 --> 00:04:41.07
we are attaching the security group

99
00:04:41.07 --> 00:04:44.04
to the EC2 instance, but the reality is

100
00:04:44.04 --> 00:04:46.08
that security groups are attached

101
00:04:46.08 --> 00:04:49.08
to the network interface,
and the network interface,

102
00:04:49.08 --> 00:04:54.06
in turn, is attached to
that EC2 instance, right?

103
00:04:54.06 --> 00:04:57.06
I'm gonna say Yes, Create,

104
00:04:57.06 --> 00:05:01.01
and we have this second
interface, over here.

105
00:05:01.01 --> 00:05:02.05
Right now, it is not attached,

106
00:05:02.05 --> 00:05:05.01
so it says "available", let's do that.

107
00:05:05.01 --> 00:05:08.09
Attach it to the running instance.

108
00:05:08.09 --> 00:05:09.07
Fantastic.

109
00:05:09.07 --> 00:05:12.06
Now, if I go back to Instances, over here,

110
00:05:12.06 --> 00:05:15.01
and I click on that one, you can see that

111
00:05:15.01 --> 00:05:17.06
we have two private IP addresses,

112
00:05:17.06 --> 00:05:20.08
and both of them show up as primary,

113
00:05:20.08 --> 00:05:25.09
and that's because I have
two network interfaces.

114
00:05:25.09 --> 00:05:28.04
Every private IPv4 address

115
00:05:28.04 --> 00:05:31.07
can be assigned a public IPv4 address.

116
00:05:31.07 --> 00:05:34.00
We'll talk about that in the next video,

117
00:05:34.00 --> 00:05:36.09
when we discuss elastic IPs.

118
00:05:36.09 --> 00:05:41.04
So it is possible to have
multiple network interfaces.

119
00:05:41.04 --> 00:05:43.09
Now, you might be thinking,
what's the use case?

120
00:05:43.09 --> 00:05:47.07
Why should I have multiple
network interfaces?

121
00:05:47.07 --> 00:05:51.06
We can separate production
traffic and management traffic.

122
00:05:51.06 --> 00:05:56.00
I can have all my
management traffic on eth0,

123
00:05:56.00 --> 00:06:00.01
and I can have all my
production traffic on eth1.

124
00:06:00.01 --> 00:06:01.04
Now, let's say I wanted to take down

125
00:06:01.04 --> 00:06:03.01
this instance for maintenance,

126
00:06:03.01 --> 00:06:07.00
and I want to redirect all this
traffic to another instance.

127
00:06:07.00 --> 00:06:08.02
It's really easy.

128
00:06:08.02 --> 00:06:11.00
I just have to detach
it from this instance,

129
00:06:11.00 --> 00:06:13.08
and attach it to another EC2 instance,

130
00:06:13.08 --> 00:06:17.06
and all the traffic
gets redirected, right?

131
00:06:17.06 --> 00:06:21.03
So it gives you so much flexibility.

132
00:06:21.03 --> 00:06:23.05
Now, let's talk about IPv6.

133
00:06:23.05 --> 00:06:25.08
Why don't we have an IPv6 address?

134
00:06:25.08 --> 00:06:29.00
Well, the reason is, the
VPC is not configured

135
00:06:29.00 --> 00:06:31.04
with an IPv6 address range.

136
00:06:31.04 --> 00:06:34.09
So if you're interested in
getting IPv6 IP addresses,

137
00:06:34.09 --> 00:06:39.05
what you need to do is,
you need to go to VPC.

138
00:06:39.05 --> 00:06:42.08
Right now, I only have my default VPC,

139
00:06:42.08 --> 00:06:45.09
so I'm gonna select that, select that VPC.

140
00:06:45.09 --> 00:06:49.09
We can see that the IPv6
CIDR range is empty.

141
00:06:49.09 --> 00:06:51.08
So we go to Actions, over here,

142
00:06:51.08 --> 00:06:57.04
and we say Edit CIDRs, and
we need to add an IPv6 CIDR.

143
00:06:57.04 --> 00:06:59.05
It automatically fills one for you.

144
00:06:59.05 --> 00:07:01.03
We can say close.

145
00:07:01.03 --> 00:07:04.00
Now, we have the IPv6 CIDR, but

146
00:07:04.00 --> 00:07:05.04
there's one more thing to do.

147
00:07:05.04 --> 00:07:09.06
We also must assign IP
addresses, or IP address ranges,

148
00:07:09.06 --> 00:07:13.08
to the subnets, so we go
back over here to Subnets.

149
00:07:13.08 --> 00:07:16.02
We select the first one.

150
00:07:16.02 --> 00:07:20.00
Subnet Actions, Edit IPv6 CIDRs,

151
00:07:20.00 --> 00:07:22.07
and we can say Add IPv6 CIDR.

152
00:07:22.07 --> 00:07:25.06
There you go.

153
00:07:25.06 --> 00:07:27.05
Okay, and we can close that, and

154
00:07:27.05 --> 00:07:29.05
I'll repeat that for the next one.

155
00:07:29.05 --> 00:07:32.08
Subnet Actions, Edit IPv6 CIDRs,

156
00:07:32.08 --> 00:07:37.05
Add IPv6 CIDR, say Yes, and Close.

157
00:07:37.05 --> 00:07:39.07
So at this point, we are now ready

158
00:07:39.07 --> 00:07:42.06
to start assigning IPv6 addresses.

159
00:07:42.06 --> 00:07:45.08
So we go back over here, and let's try

160
00:07:45.08 --> 00:07:48.07
to go back to Network Interfaces,

161
00:07:48.07 --> 00:07:51.06
and let's try to edit the first one.

162
00:07:51.06 --> 00:07:54.08
Actions, Manage IP Addresses, and notice,

163
00:07:54.08 --> 00:07:56.05
now we have that option enabled.

164
00:07:56.05 --> 00:08:00.03
So I'm gonna say Assign
new IP, auto-assign,

165
00:08:00.03 --> 00:08:02.09
Yes, and there you have it.

166
00:08:02.09 --> 00:08:07.03
So I'll close this, and
if I go back to Instances,

167
00:08:07.03 --> 00:08:11.07
now, we should have an IPv6 address.

168
00:08:11.07 --> 00:08:14.00
One last thing before we close this video,

169
00:08:14.00 --> 00:08:16.02
we'll see a document that tells us

170
00:08:16.02 --> 00:08:19.00
how many network
interfaces can be attached

171
00:08:19.00 --> 00:08:21.03
per EC2 instance type.

172
00:08:21.03 --> 00:08:22.03
That is over here.

173
00:08:22.03 --> 00:08:24.08
I'm also gonna leave a
link to this document

174
00:08:24.08 --> 00:08:27.01
in the description of this video.

175
00:08:27.01 --> 00:08:28.03
I'm gonna go down, over here,

176
00:08:28.03 --> 00:08:31.08
to t2.micro, or the t2 instances.

177
00:08:31.08 --> 00:08:33.07
So we can see that, for t2.nano,

178
00:08:33.07 --> 00:08:36.06
you can attach two network interfaces,

179
00:08:36.06 --> 00:08:39.06
and this column tells
you the maximum number

180
00:08:39.06 --> 00:08:42.08
of IP addresses per interface.

181
00:08:42.08 --> 00:08:46.07
This is for IPv4, and this is for IPv6.

182
00:08:46.07 --> 00:08:50.04
So if you look at
t2.micro, excuse me, there,

183
00:08:50.04 --> 00:08:53.05
t2.micro, we can have
two network interfaces,

184
00:08:53.05 --> 00:08:57.02
and two IPv4 addresses per interface,

185
00:08:57.02 --> 00:09:01.02
and two IPv6 addresses per interface.

186
00:09:01.02 --> 00:09:04.01
If you look at t2.large, you can have

187
00:09:04.01 --> 00:09:08.04
three network interfaces,
12 IPv4 addresses

188
00:09:08.04 --> 00:09:12.04
per network interface,
and 12 IPv6 addresses

189
00:09:12.04 --> 00:09:13.08
per network interface.

190
00:09:13.08 --> 00:09:16.09
So that's a lot of flexibility.

191
00:09:16.09 --> 00:09:19.05
Well, that's about network interfaces.

192
00:09:19.05 --> 00:09:21.02
I'd like to thank you for watching,

193
00:09:21.02 --> 00:09:22.05
and I'll catch you in the next video.

194
00:09:22.05 --> 00:09:23.06
Thank you.
