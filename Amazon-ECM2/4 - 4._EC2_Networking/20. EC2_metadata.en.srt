00:00:00.03 --> 00:00:01.06
- [Instructor] Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.06 --> 00:00:03.06
In this video, we're gonna talk about

3
00:00:03.06 --> 00:00:09.00
a very interesting topic known
as EC2 instance metadata.

4
00:00:09.00 --> 00:00:11.08
This lecture requires you
to perform some activities

5
00:00:11.08 --> 00:00:13.04
on an EC2 instance,

6
00:00:13.04 --> 00:00:16.03
so I'm gonna recommend you
to launch an EC2 instance,

7
00:00:16.03 --> 00:00:19.07
preferably a Windows and a Linux instance,

8
00:00:19.07 --> 00:00:22.06
and you do it side by side with me.

9
00:00:22.06 --> 00:00:24.07
Let's start.

10
00:00:24.07 --> 00:00:27.00
So, what is instance metadata?

11
00:00:27.00 --> 00:00:31.03
Well, instance metadata is
data about your instances

12
00:00:31.03 --> 00:00:33.07
that you can use to configure or manage

13
00:00:33.07 --> 00:00:35.07
the running instances.

14
00:00:35.07 --> 00:00:37.06
How do we get that data?

15
00:00:37.06 --> 00:00:40.05
By accessing a specific URI,

16
00:00:40.05 --> 00:00:42.04
and the URI is on your screen,

17
00:00:42.04 --> 00:00:57.01
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/.

18
00:00:57.01 --> 00:01:01.01
When you make an HTTP request
to retrieve instance metadata,

19
00:01:01.01 --> 00:01:03.04
you're not billed for that.

20
00:01:03.04 --> 00:01:05.02
Well, that's the conceptual part.

21
00:01:05.02 --> 00:01:09.04
Let's look at all of this in action.

22
00:01:09.04 --> 00:01:11.08
Alright, so I'm here on the AWS console,

23
00:01:11.08 --> 00:01:14.08
and as you can see, I have
two running instances.

24
00:01:14.08 --> 00:01:18.05
Over here, I have an Amazon Linux AMI,

25
00:01:18.05 --> 00:01:20.07
which is called as LinuxServer,

26
00:01:20.07 --> 00:01:24.00
and over here, I have
a Windows EC2 instance.

27
00:01:24.00 --> 00:01:26.02
I'm gonna first start with this one.

28
00:01:26.02 --> 00:01:28.01
I've already connected to that instance,

29
00:01:28.01 --> 00:01:31.00
so I'm gonna open up my terminal.

30
00:01:31.00 --> 00:01:32.02
Alright, as you can see,

31
00:01:32.02 --> 00:01:35.02
I've already logged into my EC2 instance.

32
00:01:35.02 --> 00:01:37.00
How do we use that URI

33
00:01:37.00 --> 00:01:39.08
to get metadata off this EC2 instance?

34
00:01:39.08 --> 00:01:42.09
It's really simple, we're
gonna use a pre-installed tool

35
00:01:42.09 --> 00:01:44.01
called as cURL.

36
00:01:44.01 --> 00:01:52.05
So you start with curl, and
then you type in that URI.

37
00:01:52.05 --> 00:01:54.03
Okay, so that's curl space

38
00:01:54.03 --> 00:02:03.04
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data.

39
00:02:03.04 --> 00:02:06.00
Remember, I told you that trailing slash,

40
00:02:06.00 --> 00:02:08.05
if you don't have it, it doesn't work.

41
00:02:08.05 --> 00:02:11.08
So, make sure that you
have that trailing slash.

42
00:02:11.08 --> 00:02:14.03
Now when I hit enter, you can see that

43
00:02:14.03 --> 00:02:17.03
there's a bunch of
information that we can query.

44
00:02:17.03 --> 00:02:21.03
For example, if I wanted
to know what is the AMI ID,

45
00:02:21.03 --> 00:02:27.09
I can append this with
ami-id, which is from here.

46
00:02:27.09 --> 00:02:29.09
Let's try that, hit enter,

47
00:02:29.09 --> 00:02:33.06
and that's the AMI ID
that I'm using right now.

48
00:02:33.06 --> 00:02:36.00
Let's say I wanted to view my instance ID,

49
00:02:36.00 --> 00:02:40.00
so I can remove that
and type in instance-id,

50
00:02:40.00 --> 00:02:43.03
and there I have it.

51
00:02:43.03 --> 00:02:45.08
Let's say I wanted to
view my instance type.

52
00:02:45.08 --> 00:02:50.08
So I can hit the up arrow,
and say instance-type,

53
00:02:50.08 --> 00:02:53.06
and we can see that it's a t2 micro.

54
00:02:53.06 --> 00:02:55.09
How about the mac address?

55
00:02:55.09 --> 00:03:02.03
So, I'll hit the up
arrow, and I'll say mac.

56
00:03:02.03 --> 00:03:05.08
How about the public IP address?

57
00:03:05.08 --> 00:03:11.08
Public-ipv4, and there
you have the public IP.

58
00:03:11.08 --> 00:03:16.02
We can also try the public host name.

59
00:03:16.02 --> 00:03:18.03
Right, so you have the public host name.

60
00:03:18.03 --> 00:03:21.00
That's how we can query and retrieve

61
00:03:21.00 --> 00:03:23.04
the EC2 instance metadata.

62
00:03:23.04 --> 00:03:24.09
It's really simple.

63
00:03:24.09 --> 00:03:28.02
If you see something like this,
which has a trailing slash,

64
00:03:28.02 --> 00:03:31.09
that means you have further
categories beyond this.

65
00:03:31.09 --> 00:03:39.03
So, for example, if I
did metadata-network/

66
00:03:39.03 --> 00:03:42.07
you can see that there's one
more, which is interfaces.

67
00:03:42.07 --> 00:03:45.08
So we can try that.

68
00:03:45.08 --> 00:03:47.02
Slash.

69
00:03:47.02 --> 00:03:50.00
And then you have something called macs.

70
00:03:50.00 --> 00:03:53.03
So, m-a-c-s slash.

71
00:03:53.03 --> 00:03:56.01
Right now, we only get one mac address,

72
00:03:56.01 --> 00:03:57.08
because on this EC2 instance,

73
00:03:57.08 --> 00:04:02.04
I have only one network
interface, which is ET80.

74
00:04:02.04 --> 00:04:04.07
If I had more network interfaces,

75
00:04:04.07 --> 00:04:07.00
I would receive more mac addresses.

76
00:04:07.00 --> 00:04:10.08
In fact, one mac address per interface.

77
00:04:10.08 --> 00:04:15.01
That's how you do it on a
Linux or a Unix EC2 instance.

78
00:04:15.01 --> 00:04:18.00
How do we do this on Windows?

79
00:04:18.00 --> 00:04:19.00
To show you that,

80
00:04:19.00 --> 00:04:23.09
I've already logged in to
a Windows EC2 instance.

81
00:04:23.09 --> 00:04:25.00
I have it over here.

82
00:04:25.00 --> 00:04:26.03
So what I have done is

83
00:04:26.03 --> 00:04:29.07
I've logged in and I've
opened up Internet Explorer.

84
00:04:29.07 --> 00:04:33.03
Now, the URI needs to be
typed into the browser,

85
00:04:33.03 --> 00:04:42.04
so it's gonna be
http://169.254.169.254/latest,

86
00:04:42.04 --> 00:04:44.06
and you can see that I've
already tried it before,

87
00:04:44.06 --> 00:04:49.08
/meta-data, don't forget
the trailing slash,

88
00:04:49.08 --> 00:04:51.05
and hit enter.

89
00:04:51.05 --> 00:04:54.05
And now, we have that
exact same information.

90
00:04:54.05 --> 00:04:56.05
If I wanted to view the AMI ID,

91
00:04:56.05 --> 00:05:00.08
I can say ami-id, hit
enter, and we can see that.

92
00:05:00.08 --> 00:05:03.05
If you wanted to go back,
hit the back button,

93
00:05:03.05 --> 00:05:05.04
and you can try some of the categories,

94
00:05:05.04 --> 00:05:12.03
like, for example, maybe public keys.

95
00:05:12.03 --> 00:05:15.06
And that's the key pair
that I'm using, right?

96
00:05:15.06 --> 00:05:18.07
So, that's about EC2 instance metadata.

97
00:05:18.07 --> 00:05:21.07
Simply put, it is data
about your EC2 instance,

98
00:05:21.07 --> 00:05:25.04
which can be used by other
applications or third-party tools

99
00:05:25.04 --> 00:05:27.08
that you might be using
in your organization.

100
00:05:27.08 --> 00:05:29.06
What's important is that URI.
