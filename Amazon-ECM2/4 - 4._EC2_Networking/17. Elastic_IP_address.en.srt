00:00:00.03 --> 00:00:01.07
- [Instructor] Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.07 --> 00:00:03.07
In this video, we're gonna talk about

3
00:00:03.07 --> 00:00:08.03
a very interesting topic
known as Elastic IP Addresses.

4
00:00:08.03 --> 00:00:10.08
Let's begin.

5
00:00:10.08 --> 00:00:13.04
Alright, so what is an Elastic IP Address?

6
00:00:13.04 --> 00:00:18.01
An Elastic IP address
is a static IPv4 address

7
00:00:18.01 --> 00:00:21.07
associated with your AWS account.

8
00:00:21.07 --> 00:00:23.07
To use an Elastic IP address,

9
00:00:23.07 --> 00:00:26.06
you must first allocate
one to your account,

10
00:00:26.06 --> 00:00:29.02
and then associate it with your instance,

11
00:00:29.02 --> 00:00:31.07
or a network interface.

12
00:00:31.07 --> 00:00:35.06
When you associate an Elastic
IP address with an instance,

13
00:00:35.06 --> 00:00:38.05
or its primary network interface,

14
00:00:38.05 --> 00:00:42.00
the instance's public IPv4 address,

15
00:00:42.00 --> 00:00:43.01
if it had one,

16
00:00:43.01 --> 00:00:45.05
is released back into Amazon's pool

17
00:00:45.05 --> 00:00:48.04
of public IPv4 address.

18
00:00:48.04 --> 00:00:52.08
And then we cannot reuse
the public IPv4 address.

19
00:00:52.08 --> 00:00:55.03
So essentially, what it tries to say

20
00:00:55.03 --> 00:00:57.04
is that if your EC2 instance

21
00:00:57.04 --> 00:01:01.00
already had a public IPv4 address,

22
00:01:01.00 --> 00:01:03.08
and you associate it an
Elastic IP with that,

23
00:01:03.08 --> 00:01:07.08
the Elastic IP will
replace your public IP.

24
00:01:07.08 --> 00:01:11.04
And then we don't get that public IP back.

25
00:01:11.04 --> 00:01:14.01
You can dissociate an Elastic IP address

26
00:01:14.01 --> 00:01:17.01
from a resource and reassociate it

27
00:01:17.01 --> 00:01:18.09
with a different resource,

28
00:01:18.09 --> 00:01:25.05
allowing you to mask the failure
of an instance or software.

29
00:01:25.05 --> 00:01:28.09
A disassociated Elastic IP
address remains allocated

30
00:01:28.09 --> 00:01:33.06
to your account until you
explicitly release it.

31
00:01:33.06 --> 00:01:37.01
To ensure efficient use
of Elastic IP addresses,

32
00:01:37.01 --> 00:01:41.02
a small hourly charge is
imposed if an Elastic IP address

33
00:01:41.02 --> 00:01:44.05
is not associated with a running instance,

34
00:01:44.05 --> 00:01:47.06
or if it associated
with a stopped instance,

35
00:01:47.06 --> 00:01:51.02
or an unattached network interface.

36
00:01:51.02 --> 00:01:54.03
In a nutshell, what AWS
is trying to tell you,

37
00:01:54.03 --> 00:01:56.03
is that if you have an Elastic IP,

38
00:01:56.03 --> 00:01:58.08
and you don't use it, we'll charge you.

39
00:01:58.08 --> 00:02:00.04
However, if you're using it,

40
00:02:00.04 --> 00:02:02.05
we're not going to charge you.

41
00:02:02.05 --> 00:02:04.04
While your instance is running,

42
00:02:04.04 --> 00:02:07.02
you are not charged for
one Elastic IP address

43
00:02:07.02 --> 00:02:09.02
associated with the instance,

44
00:02:09.02 --> 00:02:13.03
but you are charged for any
additional Elastic IP addresses

45
00:02:13.03 --> 00:02:15.03
associated with that instance.

46
00:02:15.03 --> 00:02:17.03
So one Elastic IP address

47
00:02:17.03 --> 00:02:20.07
per running EC2 instance is free of cost.

48
00:02:20.07 --> 00:02:23.02
After that, they start charging you.

49
00:02:23.02 --> 00:02:28.02
An Elastic IP address is for
use in a specific region only.

50
00:02:28.02 --> 00:02:30.02
So they are regional components,

51
00:02:30.02 --> 00:02:33.03
or components which are
specific to a region,

52
00:02:33.03 --> 00:02:37.00
just like we understood key pairs.

53
00:02:37.00 --> 00:02:40.09
When you associate an Elastic
IP address with an instance

54
00:02:40.09 --> 00:02:44.08
that previously had a public IPv4 address,

55
00:02:44.08 --> 00:02:48.08
the public DNS host name
of the instance changes

56
00:02:48.08 --> 00:02:51.04
to match the Elastic IP address.

57
00:02:51.04 --> 00:02:53.07
Don't worry if that sounds confusing.

58
00:02:53.07 --> 00:02:57.04
In just about a minute, I'll
show you exactly what I mean.

59
00:02:57.04 --> 00:03:00.07
By default, all AWS accounts are limited

60
00:03:00.07 --> 00:03:04.00
to five Elastic IP addresses per region,

61
00:03:04.00 --> 00:03:06.00
because public internet addresses

62
00:03:06.00 --> 00:03:09.07
are a scarce public resource.

63
00:03:09.07 --> 00:03:11.04
Well, that's about the concepts,

64
00:03:11.04 --> 00:03:15.01
let's look at all of this in action.

65
00:03:15.01 --> 00:03:17.08
So I'm back over here on the AWS console,

66
00:03:17.08 --> 00:03:21.00
and right now I have one Running Instance.

67
00:03:21.00 --> 00:03:23.06
So I'm gonna go over here to Instances,

68
00:03:23.06 --> 00:03:26.01
and we can see that we
have a running Instance.

69
00:03:26.01 --> 00:03:27.02
If I click on that,

70
00:03:27.02 --> 00:03:31.03
I want you to notice
that I have a public IP,

71
00:03:31.03 --> 00:03:34.05
and I also have a public DNS name,

72
00:03:34.05 --> 00:03:37.04
which has the public IP embedded in that.

73
00:03:37.04 --> 00:03:44.06
13.126.62.65 is part of
that public DNS name.

74
00:03:44.06 --> 00:03:47.02
Also notice that I have two private IPs,

75
00:03:47.02 --> 00:03:50.04
and they both belong to
the same network interface,

76
00:03:50.04 --> 00:03:52.08
which is eth0.

77
00:03:52.08 --> 00:03:57.04
Over here you can see that I
do not have any Elastic IP.

78
00:03:57.04 --> 00:03:59.03
So, what is the problem?

79
00:03:59.03 --> 00:04:02.01
Why do we even need an Elastic IP?

80
00:04:02.01 --> 00:04:05.03
Well the problem is this IP over here.

81
00:04:05.03 --> 00:04:07.04
If I stop my EC2 instance,

82
00:04:07.04 --> 00:04:09.00
and start it again,

83
00:04:09.00 --> 00:04:11.05
my public IP will change.

84
00:04:11.05 --> 00:04:14.02
So that means, all existing connections

85
00:04:14.02 --> 00:04:17.07
on this public IP will be terminated,

86
00:04:17.07 --> 00:04:18.09
which is not good.

87
00:04:18.09 --> 00:04:23.01
So I wanna make sure that I
have a consistent IPv4 address

88
00:04:23.01 --> 00:04:24.05
for my server.

89
00:04:24.05 --> 00:04:25.09
And how do I do that?

90
00:04:25.09 --> 00:04:28.02
By using Elastic IPs.

91
00:04:28.02 --> 00:04:30.07
Elastic IPs do not change

92
00:04:30.07 --> 00:04:34.01
because Elastic IPs are not
associated with your instance,

93
00:04:34.01 --> 00:04:37.06
they're associated with your AWS account.

94
00:04:37.06 --> 00:04:38.07
Let's see how to do that.

95
00:04:38.07 --> 00:04:42.06
So over here we have a
tab called Elastic IPs.

96
00:04:42.06 --> 00:04:46.05
You can see that I do not have
any addresses in this region.

97
00:04:46.05 --> 00:04:48.01
Let's go and allocate one.

98
00:04:48.01 --> 00:04:50.07
So I'm gonna say Allocate new address,

99
00:04:50.07 --> 00:04:52.02
and click on Allocate.

100
00:04:52.02 --> 00:04:54.09
So I have a new Elastic IP.

101
00:04:54.09 --> 00:04:56.02
I'm gonna click on Close.

102
00:04:56.02 --> 00:04:59.08
But right now it is not
attached or associated

103
00:04:59.08 --> 00:05:01.00
with an instance.

104
00:05:01.00 --> 00:05:03.04
So we'll go to Actions,

105
00:05:03.04 --> 00:05:06.03
and we'll click on Associate address.

106
00:05:06.03 --> 00:05:08.00
There's two ways to do this.

107
00:05:08.00 --> 00:05:10.03
You may associate it with an Instance,

108
00:05:10.03 --> 00:05:13.00
or with a network interface.

109
00:05:13.00 --> 00:05:15.02
If I select Instance,

110
00:05:15.02 --> 00:05:17.03
I have that running Instance over here,

111
00:05:17.03 --> 00:05:20.04
and remember Elastic IPs are mapped

112
00:05:20.04 --> 00:05:23.06
to an existing private IP address.

113
00:05:23.06 --> 00:05:24.07
So in this case,

114
00:05:24.07 --> 00:05:27.08
since I have two private IP
address on that Instance,

115
00:05:27.08 --> 00:05:30.03
I can select any one of them.

116
00:05:30.03 --> 00:05:32.07
Or, I could go to Network Interface,

117
00:05:32.07 --> 00:05:36.08
and I can select the Interface
to which I want to associate.

118
00:05:36.08 --> 00:05:40.07
Right now, in this case I
only have one Interface.

119
00:05:40.07 --> 00:05:42.09
But right now I'm gonna
associate it with an Instance.

120
00:05:42.09 --> 00:05:44.04
So I'll select that Instance,

121
00:05:44.04 --> 00:05:47.09
and I'll select any one of them.

122
00:05:47.09 --> 00:05:50.00
I'll click on Associate,

123
00:05:50.00 --> 00:05:50.09
it's done.

124
00:05:50.09 --> 00:05:53.06
And now when I go back to Instances,

125
00:05:53.06 --> 00:05:57.08
you'll notice that the public IP matches

126
00:05:57.08 --> 00:06:00.02
the Elastic IP,

127
00:06:00.02 --> 00:06:04.04
13.126.255.143.

128
00:06:04.04 --> 00:06:08.02
Also notice that the
DNS name has now changed

129
00:06:08.02 --> 00:06:11.09
to reflect that public IP address.

130
00:06:11.09 --> 00:06:15.04
Sorry, the Elastic IP address.

131
00:06:15.04 --> 00:06:18.05
We could associate more
than one Elastic IP address,

132
00:06:18.05 --> 00:06:22.01
because Elastic IPs are
mapped to private IPs, right?

133
00:06:22.01 --> 00:06:25.01
So this one is already mapped to this one,

134
00:06:25.01 --> 00:06:28.08
but I could associate one
more Elastic IP to this one,

135
00:06:28.08 --> 00:06:30.02
if I wanted to.

136
00:06:30.02 --> 00:06:32.05
The good part about Elastic IPs is that

137
00:06:32.05 --> 00:06:35.09
if you want to redirect your
traffic to another Instance,

138
00:06:35.09 --> 00:06:38.04
you could simply remove this,

139
00:06:38.04 --> 00:06:40.07
and associate with another Instance,

140
00:06:40.07 --> 00:06:45.06
and all the traffic gets
routed over to that Instance.

141
00:06:45.06 --> 00:06:49.05
Well, that's the simple
concept of Elastic IPs.

142
00:06:49.05 --> 00:06:51.04
They allow you to have a fixed,

143
00:06:51.04 --> 00:06:55.08
or a static public IPv4 address.

144
00:06:55.08 --> 00:06:57.01
That's it for this video.

145
00:06:57.01 --> 00:06:59.09
Just make sure that you shut
down your EC2 Instances,

146
00:06:59.09 --> 00:07:03.05
and also make sure that
you release your Elastic IP

147
00:07:03.05 --> 00:07:04.07
back to the pool,

148
00:07:04.07 --> 00:07:06.04
because if you do not do that,

149
00:07:06.04 --> 00:07:07.08
they will start charging you for that.

150
00:07:07.08 --> 00:07:10.00
So you go back to Elastic IPs,

151
00:07:10.00 --> 00:07:13.04
Actions, Dissociate the address.

152
00:07:13.04 --> 00:07:15.02
That's not the only step.

153
00:07:15.02 --> 00:07:17.00
We have to go back to Actions,

154
00:07:17.00 --> 00:07:19.08
and release it back to the pool.

155
00:07:19.08 --> 00:07:20.07
Now we're done,

156
00:07:20.07 --> 00:07:24.02
and we can shut down
that Instance as well.

157
00:07:24.02 --> 00:07:25.03
Well, that's it for this video.

158
00:07:25.03 --> 00:07:26.09
I'd like to thank you for watching,

159
00:07:26.09 --> 00:07:29.03
and I'll catch you in the
next video, thank you.
