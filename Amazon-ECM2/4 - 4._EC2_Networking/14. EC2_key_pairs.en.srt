1
00:00:00.08 --> 00:00:02.03
- Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.03 --> 00:00:06.00
In this video, we're going
to talk about key pairs.

3
00:00:06.00 --> 00:00:08.03
Key pairs are fundamental for EC2,

4
00:00:08.03 --> 00:00:11.03
because key pairs allow
you to login to Unix based

5
00:00:11.03 --> 00:00:15.02
or Linux based EC2 instances,
and for Windows devices,

6
00:00:15.02 --> 00:00:19.07
they allow you to decrypt
and reveal their password.

7
00:00:19.07 --> 00:00:24.03
Amazon EC2 uses public-key
cryptography to encrypt

8
00:00:24.03 --> 00:00:27.04
and decrypt login information.

9
00:00:27.04 --> 00:00:30.04
Public-key cryptography uses a public key

10
00:00:30.04 --> 00:00:33.07
to encrypt a piece of
data, such as a password,

11
00:00:33.07 --> 00:00:36.02
and then, the recipient
uses the private key

12
00:00:36.02 --> 00:00:38.01
to decrypt the data.

13
00:00:38.01 --> 00:00:41.01
The interesting thing about
public-key cryptography is,

14
00:00:41.01 --> 00:00:43.05
anything that is encrypted
with the public key

15
00:00:43.05 --> 00:00:46.08
can only be decrypted with a private key.

16
00:00:46.08 --> 00:00:49.01
The same key which was used for encryption

17
00:00:49.01 --> 00:00:52.02
cannot be used for decryption.

18
00:00:52.02 --> 00:00:54.08
The combination of public and private key

19
00:00:54.08 --> 00:00:57.02
is known as a key pair.

20
00:00:57.02 --> 00:01:02.06
It's two keys together, so
we call them as a key pair.

21
00:01:02.06 --> 00:01:06.03
To login to your instance,
you must create a key pair,

22
00:01:06.03 --> 00:01:07.09
specify the name of the key pair

23
00:01:07.09 --> 00:01:09.06
when you launch the instance,

24
00:01:09.06 --> 00:01:11.01
and then, provide the key pair

25
00:01:11.01 --> 00:01:14.02
when you try to connect to that instance.

26
00:01:14.02 --> 00:01:16.03
On a Linux EC2 instance,

27
00:01:16.03 --> 00:01:19.05
the public-key content
is placed as an entry

28
00:01:19.05 --> 00:01:25.05
within the directory, which
/.ssh/authorized_keys.

29
00:01:25.05 --> 00:01:27.07
This is done automatically at boot time,

30
00:01:27.07 --> 00:01:30.08
and enables you to securely
access your instance

31
00:01:30.08 --> 00:01:36.05
using private keys instead of passwords.

32
00:01:36.05 --> 00:01:40.03
Key pairs can be created
using the Amazon EC2 console,

33
00:01:40.03 --> 00:01:43.01
or you could also use a third-party tool,

34
00:01:43.01 --> 00:01:46.09
and then import the
public key to Amazon EC2.

35
00:01:46.09 --> 00:01:47.08
How do we do that?

36
00:01:47.08 --> 00:01:50.09
I will show you that
in just about a minute.

37
00:01:50.09 --> 00:01:55.03
Very important, Amazon EC2
only stores the public key,

38
00:01:55.03 --> 00:01:57.08
and we store the private key.

39
00:01:57.08 --> 00:01:59.08
That's why we call it as private,

40
00:01:59.08 --> 00:02:04.02
something that we should not
be sharing with anybody else.

41
00:02:04.02 --> 00:02:08.02
Amazon EC2 does not keep a
copy of your private key.

42
00:02:08.02 --> 00:02:11.01
Therefore, if you lose the private key,

43
00:02:11.01 --> 00:02:14.03
there is no way to recover it.

44
00:02:14.03 --> 00:02:16.07
The keys that Amazon EC2 uses

45
00:02:16.07 --> 00:02:20.08
are 2048-bit SSH-2 RSA keys only.

46
00:02:20.08 --> 00:02:24.05
DSA not supported, it has to be RSA.

47
00:02:24.05 --> 00:02:29.02
You can have up to 5000
key pairs per region.

48
00:02:29.02 --> 00:02:31.02
Okay, now let's dive into the console

49
00:02:31.02 --> 00:02:35.06
and see how we can import a new key pair.

50
00:02:35.06 --> 00:02:38.06
All right, so I've logged
into the AWS EC2 console,

51
00:02:38.06 --> 00:02:42.08
and first of all, I'm gonna
go over here to Key Pairs.

52
00:02:42.08 --> 00:02:47.06
So right now, I have one
key pair, which is MyEC2Key.

53
00:02:47.06 --> 00:02:51.00
Remember, key pairs are
regional, which means

54
00:02:51.00 --> 00:02:53.06
the key pair that I have
in the Mumbai region

55
00:02:53.06 --> 00:02:57.02
is not the same that I
have in some other region.

56
00:02:57.02 --> 00:02:58.04
We can verify that.

57
00:02:58.04 --> 00:03:03.03
I'm gonna open another window over here,

58
00:03:03.03 --> 00:03:05.07
and I'm gonna change my region to,

59
00:03:05.07 --> 00:03:08.03
let's say, North Virginia,

60
00:03:08.03 --> 00:03:10.09
and over here, we can see that
we have a different key pair,

61
00:03:10.09 --> 00:03:13.08
which is called as nvkey.

62
00:03:13.08 --> 00:03:16.09
So, that means keypairs are regional.

63
00:03:16.09 --> 00:03:19.03
If you wanted to create a new key pair

64
00:03:19.03 --> 00:03:22.08
within the EC2 console,
you can do Create Key Pair,

65
00:03:22.08 --> 00:03:25.08
or if you wanted to
import your own key pair,

66
00:03:25.08 --> 00:03:27.06
you would use this option.

67
00:03:27.06 --> 00:03:30.08
But before we import it,
we must have it ready.

68
00:03:30.08 --> 00:03:32.02
So, let's do that.

69
00:03:32.02 --> 00:03:35.05
Let's go to the terminal
and create a new key pair.

70
00:03:35.05 --> 00:03:37.07
All right, so I'm here at the terminal.

71
00:03:37.07 --> 00:03:39.09
First of all, I'm going
to elevate my privleges

72
00:03:39.09 --> 00:03:43.05
with sudo su.

73
00:03:43.05 --> 00:03:44.03
Done.

74
00:03:44.03 --> 00:03:48.02
Next, I'm gonna use ssh-keygen -t,

75
00:03:48.02 --> 00:03:51.06
and the name of the
algorithm, which is RSA.

76
00:03:51.06 --> 00:03:53.01
Hit enter.

77
00:03:53.01 --> 00:03:54.08
It says, "Enter the file name."

78
00:03:54.08 --> 00:03:56.02
I'm gonna say Enter.

79
00:03:56.02 --> 00:03:58.09
Do you wanna create a
password for that, no.

80
00:03:58.09 --> 00:04:01.08
Hit enter, perfect, it's done.

81
00:04:01.08 --> 00:04:03.07
Now, I'm gonna navigate into that folder,

82
00:04:03.07 --> 00:04:09.04
which is /var/root/.ssh.

83
00:04:09.04 --> 00:04:11.07
Ls will show me all the files.

84
00:04:11.07 --> 00:04:13.00
So, you have two files.

85
00:04:13.00 --> 00:04:14.05
This one is the public key,

86
00:04:14.05 --> 00:04:16.03
and this one is the private key.

87
00:04:16.03 --> 00:04:18.00
If you want to view the contents of that,

88
00:04:18.00 --> 00:04:23.05
we can do cat id_rsa.pub.

89
00:04:23.05 --> 00:04:24.09
That's the public key.

90
00:04:24.09 --> 00:04:26.02
If you want to view the private key,

91
00:04:26.02 --> 00:04:29.02
you can do cat id_rsa,

92
00:04:29.02 --> 00:04:31.07
and that will give us the private key.

93
00:04:31.07 --> 00:04:33.07
All right, so let's copy that.

94
00:04:33.07 --> 00:04:37.05
Let's copy that public key.

95
00:04:37.05 --> 00:04:40.07
That's the public key, Ctrl-C for copy.

96
00:04:40.07 --> 00:04:44.06
Back over here, to the AWS
console, Import Key Pair.

97
00:04:44.06 --> 00:04:48.04
You can either Browse or
just paste it over here.

98
00:04:48.04 --> 00:04:50.07
I'm gonna call it as mykey.

99
00:04:50.07 --> 00:04:53.02
Paste it over here, click on Import.

100
00:04:53.02 --> 00:04:54.08
Fantastic, it's done.

101
00:04:54.08 --> 00:04:57.00
Now, let's see if it's working.

102
00:04:57.00 --> 00:05:00.03
To do that, I'm gonna
launch a new EC2 instance.

103
00:05:00.03 --> 00:05:05.06
Go to Instances, Launch
Instance, Amazon Linux AMI.

104
00:05:05.06 --> 00:05:07.04
This time, I'm gonna do t2.nano.

105
00:05:07.04 --> 00:05:10.04
You can even use t2.micro.

106
00:05:10.04 --> 00:05:14.05
Click on Next, I'm not gonna
change anything right now.

107
00:05:14.05 --> 00:05:18.00
Just select a security
group which allows SSH.

108
00:05:18.00 --> 00:05:20.08
Review and Launch, Launch, and make sure

109
00:05:20.08 --> 00:05:26.08
you select the new keypair,
which is mykey, and done.

110
00:05:26.08 --> 00:05:29.09
View Instances.

111
00:05:29.09 --> 00:05:34.02
Refresh.

112
00:05:34.02 --> 00:05:36.07
All right, now it is in a running state.

113
00:05:36.07 --> 00:05:41.03
So, I'm gonna copy that public IP address,

114
00:05:41.03 --> 00:05:43.00
come back to the terminal.

115
00:05:43.00 --> 00:05:46.02
I'll first do Clear.

116
00:05:46.02 --> 00:05:50.02
Verify my directory, pwd, perfect.

117
00:05:50.02 --> 00:05:56.01
Now, I'm gonna say ssh
ec2-user@ the public IP -i,

118
00:05:56.01 --> 00:06:01.03
and the private key name is ID_RSA.

119
00:06:01.03 --> 00:06:04.03
Hit Enter, and it says, "Are
you sure you want to continue?"

120
00:06:04.03 --> 00:06:08.07
I'm gonna say yes, and
I'm directly logged in.

121
00:06:08.07 --> 00:06:11.04
We can verify that with
the private IP address

122
00:06:11.04 --> 00:06:16.03
once I'm into 3120238.

123
00:06:16.03 --> 00:06:20.06
Once I'm into 3120238.

124
00:06:20.06 --> 00:06:22.09
So that's how you create
and import a key pair

125
00:06:22.09 --> 00:06:24.04
on a Linux device.

126
00:06:24.04 --> 00:06:27.08
Now, I'll show you how to
do that on a Windows device.

127
00:06:27.08 --> 00:06:31.03
Before that, I'm gonna
terminate this instance.

128
00:06:31.03 --> 00:06:33.09
Terminate.

129
00:06:33.09 --> 00:06:36.05
Okay, and I'll go back
to Key Pairs over here,

130
00:06:36.05 --> 00:06:40.02
and I'll delete this one.

131
00:06:40.02 --> 00:06:43.01
To show you how this
works on a Windows device,

132
00:06:43.01 --> 00:06:47.04
I'm gonna open up a virtual
machine using Virtual Box,

133
00:06:47.04 --> 00:06:49.05
and I have that over here.

134
00:06:49.05 --> 00:06:53.01
On Windows devices, you cannot
directly create a key pair

135
00:06:53.01 --> 00:06:55.07
like how you can do it on Linux devices.

136
00:06:55.07 --> 00:06:59.02
For that, we need a
program called PuTTY Gen.

137
00:06:59.02 --> 00:07:01.03
If you've seen the other
videos on how to connect

138
00:07:01.03 --> 00:07:05.00
to an EC2 instance from
Windows, you already have this,

139
00:07:05.00 --> 00:07:06.06
because we installed this.

140
00:07:06.06 --> 00:07:08.03
Just in case you don't have that,

141
00:07:08.03 --> 00:07:10.01
just search for PuTTY download,

142
00:07:10.01 --> 00:07:11.05
and you should be able to get that.

143
00:07:11.05 --> 00:07:12.07
There are two files.

144
00:07:12.07 --> 00:07:16.05
There's one called PuTTY, and
there's one called PuTTY Gen.

145
00:07:16.05 --> 00:07:20.09
To start with, I'm gonna use PuTTY Gen.

146
00:07:20.09 --> 00:07:23.00
PuTTY Gen, and it says over here,

147
00:07:23.00 --> 00:07:26.03
"Generate a public-private key pair."

148
00:07:26.03 --> 00:07:28.01
So, I'm gonna click on Generate.

149
00:07:28.01 --> 00:07:33.01
Make sure that the algorithm
that you use is RSA.

150
00:07:33.01 --> 00:07:34.01
Now, here's the fun part.

151
00:07:34.01 --> 00:07:36.07
It says, "Please generate some randomness

152
00:07:36.07 --> 00:07:39.01
"by moving the mouse over the blank area."

153
00:07:39.01 --> 00:07:42.09
So, you gotta move your mouse.

154
00:07:42.09 --> 00:07:45.06
And, as you keep moving
that, you'll notice

155
00:07:45.06 --> 00:07:54.04
this keeps moving as well.

156
00:07:54.04 --> 00:07:55.09
All right, so that's done.

157
00:07:55.09 --> 00:07:57.09
This is the public key
that we need to copy

158
00:07:57.09 --> 00:08:00.00
and paste it into EWS.

159
00:08:00.00 --> 00:08:01.04
Where's the private key?

160
00:08:01.04 --> 00:08:02.07
Well, it's over here.

161
00:08:02.07 --> 00:08:04.08
You can say, "Save private key".

162
00:08:04.08 --> 00:08:07.06
"Are you sure you want to
save this without a password?"

163
00:08:07.06 --> 00:08:08.07
Yes.

164
00:08:08.07 --> 00:08:10.01
I'm gonna put it on my desktop,

165
00:08:10.01 --> 00:08:14.03
and I'm gonna call this as my private key.

166
00:08:14.03 --> 00:08:19.00
Click on Save, and you have it over here.

167
00:08:19.00 --> 00:08:20.08
I'm also gonna save my public key.

168
00:08:20.08 --> 00:08:22.03
So, Save Public Key.

169
00:08:22.03 --> 00:08:27.00
Let's call this one as mypubkey,

170
00:08:27.00 --> 00:08:29.06
and click on Save.

171
00:08:29.06 --> 00:08:31.00
And it saved over here.

172
00:08:31.00 --> 00:08:33.01
Next, we need to import this.

173
00:08:33.01 --> 00:08:39.03
So, I'm gonna open up the AWS
console, just refresh it once.

174
00:08:39.03 --> 00:08:44.01
All right, and then, I'll go
down over here to Key Pairs.

175
00:08:44.01 --> 00:08:45.06
I'm gonna import a new key pair.

176
00:08:45.06 --> 00:08:51.02
Let's call it as winkey,
for Windows, maybe.

177
00:08:51.02 --> 00:08:54.02
And then, we need to paste
the public key content.

178
00:08:54.02 --> 00:08:56.00
So, go back over here.

179
00:08:56.00 --> 00:08:58.04
I'm gonna select all of this first.

180
00:08:58.04 --> 00:08:59.08
In fact, I'm gonna select it.

181
00:08:59.08 --> 00:09:04.05
I'll just copy it, go back
over here and paste it,

182
00:09:04.05 --> 00:09:06.05
and click on Import.

183
00:09:06.05 --> 00:09:09.03
All right, once that is done,
we can now try to connect.

184
00:09:09.03 --> 00:09:12.01
To connect, we are not
gonna be using PuTTY Gen,

185
00:09:12.01 --> 00:09:15.06
but we're gonna be using PuTTY.

186
00:09:15.06 --> 00:09:17.02
PuTTY.

187
00:09:17.02 --> 00:09:20.02
Okay, but before that, we need
to launch an EC2 instance.

188
00:09:20.02 --> 00:09:25.03
So, we'll go back to
Instances, Launch Instance,

189
00:09:25.03 --> 00:09:27.06
Amazon Linux AMI.

190
00:09:27.06 --> 00:09:30.08
I'm gonna do t2.micro.

191
00:09:30.08 --> 00:09:32.09
And, I'm just gonna skip all of this.

192
00:09:32.09 --> 00:09:34.02
I'm not changing anything,

193
00:09:34.02 --> 00:09:36.02
I'm just going to add a security group

194
00:09:36.02 --> 00:09:39.02
which allows SSH.

195
00:09:39.02 --> 00:09:42.08
Review and Launch, Launch,
and make sure you select

196
00:09:42.08 --> 00:09:47.09
the right key pair, winkey, and launch it.

197
00:09:47.09 --> 00:09:51.03
View Instances, and we just need to wait

198
00:09:51.03 --> 00:09:53.01
until this becomes running.

199
00:09:53.01 --> 00:09:55.00
So, I'll refresh that.

200
00:09:55.00 --> 00:09:56.09
All right, and I'm gonna copy

201
00:09:56.09 --> 00:09:59.07
the public IP address from here.

202
00:09:59.07 --> 00:10:01.02
Go back to PuTTY.

203
00:10:01.02 --> 00:10:03.04
At this point, you
should know how to login

204
00:10:03.04 --> 00:10:06.09
to a Linux EC2 instance
from a Windows device.

205
00:10:06.09 --> 00:10:10.03
We spoke about this in one
of the earlier lectures.

206
00:10:10.03 --> 00:10:12.01
We'll revise it one more time.

207
00:10:12.01 --> 00:10:19.05
So, in Host Name, we're gonna
say ec2-user@ the public IP.

208
00:10:19.05 --> 00:10:23.02
And then, we open up
SSH, we click on Auth,

209
00:10:23.02 --> 00:10:25.05
we click on Browse, and then,

210
00:10:25.05 --> 00:10:29.00
we select the private key
file, which is my private key.

211
00:10:29.00 --> 00:10:32.09
Open, and we can say Open.

212
00:10:32.09 --> 00:10:35.07
It says, if you trust the file, hit Yes.

213
00:10:35.07 --> 00:10:38.02
I'm gonna say Yes, and you've logged in.

214
00:10:38.02 --> 00:10:39.08
We can verify with the private IP,

215
00:10:39.08 --> 00:10:44.05
which is 172313203.

216
00:10:44.05 --> 00:10:49.08
We have the same one over here, 172313203.

217
00:10:49.08 --> 00:10:51.05
Well, that's about key pairs.

218
00:10:51.05 --> 00:10:53.03
I hope you found it interesting.

219
00:10:53.03 --> 00:10:55.02
Don't forget to turn off your lab.

220
00:10:55.02 --> 00:10:56.08
I'd like to thank you for watching,

221
00:10:56.08 --> 00:10:58.02
and I'll catch you in the next video.

222
00:10:58.02 --> 00:10:59.02
Thank you.
