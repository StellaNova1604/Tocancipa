00:00:00.09 --> 00:00:02.01
- [Instructor] Welcome back.

2
00:00:02.01 --> 00:00:03.01
In this video,

3
00:00:03.01 --> 00:00:07.02
we're gonna talk about
elastic network interfaces.

4
00:00:07.02 --> 00:00:11.02
If you're ready, let's begin.

5
00:00:11.02 --> 00:00:14.00
All right, so what is an
elastic network interface?

6
00:00:14.00 --> 00:00:16.03
Well, an elastic network interface

7
00:00:16.03 --> 00:00:19.09
is a logical networking component in a VPC

8
00:00:19.09 --> 00:00:23.04
that represents a virtual network card.

9
00:00:23.04 --> 00:00:27.00
Think about a physical
desktop or a physical laptop.

10
00:00:27.00 --> 00:00:31.04
Each of these devices has a
physical network interface card,

11
00:00:31.04 --> 00:00:33.06
where we actually plug in that LAN card

12
00:00:33.06 --> 00:00:37.00
or the interface that we
enable to connect to the Wi-Fi.

13
00:00:37.00 --> 00:00:39.01
That's a physical network card.

14
00:00:39.01 --> 00:00:43.02
Similarly, EC2 instances
have a virtual network card,

15
00:00:43.02 --> 00:00:47.06
which is called as the
elastic network interface.

16
00:00:47.06 --> 00:00:49.07
We can create a network interface,

17
00:00:49.07 --> 00:00:51.04
attach it to an instance,

18
00:00:51.04 --> 00:00:53.00
detach it from an instance,

19
00:00:53.00 --> 00:00:56.08
and also attach it back
to another instance,

20
00:00:56.08 --> 00:01:00.00
which makes them very, very flexible.

21
00:01:00.00 --> 00:01:02.00
When you move a network interface

22
00:01:02.00 --> 00:01:04.00
from one instance to another,

23
00:01:04.00 --> 00:01:08.08
network traffic is redirected
to the new instance.

24
00:01:08.08 --> 00:01:13.03
Every instance in a VPC has
a default network interface,

25
00:01:13.03 --> 00:01:16.01
which is called as the
primary network interface

26
00:01:16.01 --> 00:01:20.04
and represented by eth0.

27
00:01:20.04 --> 00:01:23.07
We cannot detach the
primary network interface

28
00:01:23.07 --> 00:01:25.01
from an instance.

29
00:01:25.01 --> 00:01:31.07
We can create and attach
additional network interfaces.

30
00:01:31.07 --> 00:01:35.02
What are the attributes of
an elastic network interface?

31
00:01:35.02 --> 00:01:36.02
Number one,

32
00:01:36.02 --> 00:01:38.00
every elastic network interface

33
00:01:38.00 --> 00:01:41.01
has a primary private IPv4 address

34
00:01:41.01 --> 00:01:45.02
from the IPv4 address range of your VPC.

35
00:01:45.02 --> 00:01:47.06
It may also have one or more

36
00:01:47.06 --> 00:01:48.07
secondary

37
00:01:48.07 --> 00:01:50.08
private IPv4 addresses

38
00:01:50.08 --> 00:01:54.07
from the IPv4 address range of your VPC.

39
00:01:54.07 --> 00:01:59.01
It may also have one Elastic IPv4 address

40
00:01:59.01 --> 00:02:02.02
per private IPv4 address.

41
00:02:02.02 --> 00:02:06.00
It may also have one public IPv4 address,

42
00:02:06.00 --> 00:02:07.01
one or more

43
00:02:07.01 --> 00:02:09.06
IPv6 addresses,

44
00:02:09.06 --> 00:02:12.00
one or more security groups,

45
00:02:12.00 --> 00:02:13.08
also a MAC address,

46
00:02:13.08 --> 00:02:16.02
a source or destination check flag,

47
00:02:16.02 --> 00:02:18.09
which is a flag that
checks if the interface

48
00:02:18.09 --> 00:02:22.01
is the source or
destination of the traffic,

49
00:02:22.01 --> 00:02:28.08
and, additionally, it may
also have a description.

50
00:02:28.08 --> 00:02:30.05
Talking about best practices,

51
00:02:30.05 --> 00:02:33.02
we can attach a network
interface to an instance

52
00:02:33.02 --> 00:02:34.06
when it's running.

53
00:02:34.06 --> 00:02:37.01
This is called as hot attach.

54
00:02:37.01 --> 00:02:39.07
We can also attach it when it is stopped.

55
00:02:39.07 --> 00:02:41.06
It's called as a warm attach.

56
00:02:41.06 --> 00:02:43.03
Or we may also attach it

57
00:02:43.03 --> 00:02:45.04
when the instance is being launched,

58
00:02:45.04 --> 00:02:48.02
which is known as a cold attach.

59
00:02:48.02 --> 00:02:51.03
We can detach secondary network interfaces

60
00:02:51.03 --> 00:02:53.08
when the instance is running or stopped.

61
00:02:53.08 --> 00:02:57.04
However, we cannot detach the
primary network interface,

62
00:02:57.04 --> 00:03:00.02
which is eth0.

63
00:03:00.02 --> 00:03:04.07
The secondary network interface
is represented as ethN,

64
00:03:04.07 --> 00:03:09.05
which is nothing but
eth1, eth2, 3, and so on.

65
00:03:09.05 --> 00:03:12.07
If you attach two or
more network interfaces

66
00:03:12.07 --> 00:03:15.05
from the same subnet to an instance,

67
00:03:15.05 --> 00:03:17.07
you may encounter networking issues

68
00:03:17.07 --> 00:03:19.05
such as asymmetric routing.

69
00:03:19.05 --> 00:03:20.09
So it is not recommended

70
00:03:20.09 --> 00:03:23.05
that you attach two or more interfaces

71
00:03:23.05 --> 00:03:27.03
from the same subnet to the same instance.

72
00:03:27.03 --> 00:03:29.00
Having understood the concepts,

73
00:03:29.00 --> 00:03:31.09
let's look at all of
this on the EC2 console.
