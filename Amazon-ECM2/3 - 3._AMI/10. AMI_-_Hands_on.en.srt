00:00:00.01 --> 00:00:01.04
- [Narrator] Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.04 --> 00:00:04.02
In this video, we're
going to do some hands on

3
00:00:04.02 --> 00:00:07.02
exercises on AMIs.

4
00:00:07.02 --> 00:00:10.04
In one of the earlier
lectures, we spoke about AMIs,

5
00:00:10.04 --> 00:00:13.06
or Amazon Machine Images,
and we spoke about this

6
00:00:13.06 --> 00:00:16.07
in the lecture where we
understood how to launch

7
00:00:16.07 --> 00:00:18.05
an EC2 instance.

8
00:00:18.05 --> 00:00:21.06
We saw that selecting
an AMI is the first step

9
00:00:21.06 --> 00:00:24.01
when you are creating an EC2 instance,

10
00:00:24.01 --> 00:00:27.02
and we also understood
that an AMI is a template

11
00:00:27.02 --> 00:00:30.02
that contains all the required information

12
00:00:30.02 --> 00:00:32.01
to launch an EC2 instance.

13
00:00:32.01 --> 00:00:34.06
In this video, we're going to understand

14
00:00:34.06 --> 00:00:38.09
how to create our own custom AMIs.

15
00:00:38.09 --> 00:00:42.00
If you are ready, let's begin.

16
00:00:42.00 --> 00:00:45.03
All right, so right now
I'm at the AWS console

17
00:00:45.03 --> 00:00:48.01
and as you can see right
now I have a running

18
00:00:48.01 --> 00:00:50.03
Windows EC2 instance.

19
00:00:50.03 --> 00:00:53.07
This one is a Windows 2008 instance

20
00:00:53.07 --> 00:00:59.02
and I have already connected
to this EC2 instance.

21
00:00:59.02 --> 00:01:01.03
So, here you can see that
I'm already connected

22
00:01:01.03 --> 00:01:04.06
to that EC2 instance and
after connecting I have

23
00:01:04.06 --> 00:01:07.09
installed something called as XAMPP.

24
00:01:07.09 --> 00:01:09.09
XAMPP is an Apache distribution

25
00:01:09.09 --> 00:01:11.05
and it's an open source tool.

26
00:01:11.05 --> 00:01:14.08
So, you can see that I
already have it installed.

27
00:01:14.08 --> 00:01:16.08
The reason I'm doing this is to show you

28
00:01:16.08 --> 00:01:18.07
what happens when you create an AMI

29
00:01:18.07 --> 00:01:21.05
out of this EC2 instance.

30
00:01:21.05 --> 00:01:24.03
Let's go back to the AWS console.

31
00:01:24.03 --> 00:01:26.08
Back over here, when I
select the EC2 instance

32
00:01:26.08 --> 00:01:29.07
you can see that I have
two volumes attached

33
00:01:29.07 --> 00:01:32.07
to that EC2 instance,
and I can confirm this

34
00:01:32.07 --> 00:01:34.06
by going to volumes over here.

35
00:01:34.06 --> 00:01:37.02
So you can see that we
have a couple of volumes.

36
00:01:37.02 --> 00:01:40.06
One is 30 gigs, and
one is one gig in size.

37
00:01:40.06 --> 00:01:43.06
Before we start the
process of creating the AMI

38
00:01:43.06 --> 00:01:46.08
let's first launch a
continuous ping on the public

39
00:01:46.08 --> 00:01:49.04
IP address of that EC2 instance.

40
00:01:49.04 --> 00:01:51.04
So, I'll go back to instances over here,

41
00:01:51.04 --> 00:01:56.05
copy that public IP
address, open up a terminal,

42
00:01:56.05 --> 00:02:00.07
and I'm gonna do a ping, and
the IP address, hit enter.

43
00:02:00.07 --> 00:02:04.08
So right now we have connectivity
to that EC2 instance.

44
00:02:04.08 --> 00:02:07.08
If I wanted to create an
AMI I would select that

45
00:02:07.08 --> 00:02:12.09
EC2 instance, go to actions,
image, create image.

46
00:02:12.09 --> 00:02:15.07
We can give it a name.

47
00:02:15.07 --> 00:02:20.02
I'm gonna call it as
Windows 2008 with XAMPP.

48
00:02:20.02 --> 00:02:22.05
Notice that both the
volumes are going to be

49
00:02:22.05 --> 00:02:25.09
part of the AMI, and we
also have a check box

50
00:02:25.09 --> 00:02:28.09
over here that says no reboot.

51
00:02:28.09 --> 00:02:31.05
Right now I'm gonna leave that unchecked

52
00:02:31.05 --> 00:02:33.09
and see what happens.

53
00:02:33.09 --> 00:02:36.07
Now, I'm gonna click on
create image over here

54
00:02:36.07 --> 00:02:39.05
and we can see that the
create image request

55
00:02:39.05 --> 00:02:43.01
has been received and the
process has been started.

56
00:02:43.01 --> 00:02:45.06
I'm gonna close that and
go back to the terminal

57
00:02:45.06 --> 00:02:48.00
to see what happens.

58
00:02:48.00 --> 00:02:51.03
Back over here, the ping is still working.

59
00:02:51.03 --> 00:02:53.09
I'm gonna give it about 30 seconds or so.

60
00:02:53.09 --> 00:02:59.01
In fact, you can see that it
has already started timing out,

61
00:02:59.01 --> 00:03:02.09
which means the EC2
instance has been rebooted

62
00:03:02.09 --> 00:03:06.05
and this is something
very critical to know.

63
00:03:06.05 --> 00:03:11.08
EC2 instances will be rebooted
if you try to create an AMI.

64
00:03:11.08 --> 00:03:14.01
Right, if you don't want this to happen,

65
00:03:14.01 --> 00:03:16.04
what you could do is you
could use the option called

66
00:03:16.04 --> 00:03:19.08
no reboot, however, if
there is any data which is

67
00:03:19.08 --> 00:03:24.02
sitting in the cache that
would not be a part of the AMI.

68
00:03:24.02 --> 00:03:27.02
To make sure that all the
data is included in the AMI

69
00:03:27.02 --> 00:03:32.04
ideally you want that EC2
instance to be rebooted.

70
00:03:32.04 --> 00:03:35.03
Back over here, now I'm
gonna wait for some time

71
00:03:35.03 --> 00:03:38.03
for that EC2 instance to come back online.

72
00:03:38.03 --> 00:03:41.05
Meanwhile, we can go to
AMIs and we can see that

73
00:03:41.05 --> 00:03:44.06
the AMI is being provisioned.

74
00:03:44.06 --> 00:03:47.00
I'm gonna pause the video
here for a couple of minutes

75
00:03:47.00 --> 00:03:51.09
until this moves to the available state.

76
00:03:51.09 --> 00:03:54.08
All right, so after waiting
for about three minutes

77
00:03:54.08 --> 00:03:57.00
the AMI is now completed.

78
00:03:57.00 --> 00:03:58.07
The process has been completed,

79
00:03:58.07 --> 00:04:01.03
and it is now available, which means

80
00:04:01.03 --> 00:04:06.02
we can now use the AMI to
create new EC2 instances.

81
00:04:06.02 --> 00:04:07.04
Let's do that now.

82
00:04:07.04 --> 00:04:12.04
I'm gonna go to actions,
and I'm gonna say launch.

83
00:04:12.04 --> 00:04:16.02
So now we are in the EC2
instance launch wizard.

84
00:04:16.02 --> 00:04:18.04
I'm gonna say configure instance details.

85
00:04:18.04 --> 00:04:20.07
I'm not gonna change anything over here,

86
00:04:20.07 --> 00:04:22.06
leave everything at the default.

87
00:04:22.06 --> 00:04:25.07
Notice that all the volumes from the AMI

88
00:04:25.07 --> 00:04:28.09
or the original EC2 instance
are found over here.

89
00:04:28.09 --> 00:04:31.03
We have the 30 gigs
volume, and we also have

90
00:04:31.03 --> 00:04:33.00
the one gig volume.

91
00:04:33.00 --> 00:04:35.04
If we did not want to
use this one over here,

92
00:04:35.04 --> 00:04:38.02
the additional volume, we can remove that,

93
00:04:38.02 --> 00:04:45.08
click on next, and I'm
gonna name it as WinServer2.

94
00:04:45.08 --> 00:04:47.08
Configure security
group, and I'm gonna use

95
00:04:47.08 --> 00:04:51.04
an existing security group
that allows RDP traffic,

96
00:04:51.04 --> 00:04:55.03
preview and launch and launch,
and I'm gonna acknowledge

97
00:04:55.03 --> 00:04:58.07
that I have access to that key pair.

98
00:04:58.07 --> 00:05:00.05
Launch instances.

99
00:05:00.05 --> 00:05:02.04
Now, the instance is being launched.

100
00:05:02.04 --> 00:05:04.02
We can click on view instances,

101
00:05:04.02 --> 00:05:07.08
and we see that WinServer2
is now being launched.

102
00:05:07.08 --> 00:05:10.05
Now, this can take about
two to three minutes.

103
00:05:10.05 --> 00:05:13.07
So meanwhile, I'm gonna
go back to AMIs over here.

104
00:05:13.07 --> 00:05:17.02
We have that AMI, and
I'm also gonna show you

105
00:05:17.02 --> 00:05:18.07
snapshots over here.

106
00:05:18.07 --> 00:05:21.08
So we can see that we
have snapshots of both

107
00:05:21.08 --> 00:05:25.00
the volumes of the original EC2 instance,

108
00:05:25.00 --> 00:05:28.08
the 30 gig volume, and the
one gig volume as well.

109
00:05:28.08 --> 00:05:32.00
Whenever you create a new AMI the new AMI

110
00:05:32.00 --> 00:05:35.04
is automatically registered,
which means it becomes

111
00:05:35.04 --> 00:05:39.00
available to create new EC2 instances.

112
00:05:39.00 --> 00:05:41.08
If however you do not
want to allow the creation

113
00:05:41.08 --> 00:05:45.09
of new instances from that
AMI you can de-register that

114
00:05:45.09 --> 00:05:49.07
by going to actions, de-register.

115
00:05:49.07 --> 00:05:52.08
If you want to modify the
permissions of that AMI

116
00:05:52.08 --> 00:05:55.02
you can go to modify image permissions.

117
00:05:55.02 --> 00:05:59.07
Right now the AMI's owned by
you and not shared with anyone.

118
00:05:59.07 --> 00:06:01.04
If you would like to
share it with specific

119
00:06:01.04 --> 00:06:05.01
AWS accounts you can use
this option called private,

120
00:06:05.01 --> 00:06:08.03
and you can use the AWS
account number of the person

121
00:06:08.03 --> 00:06:13.04
or the organization with
which you'd like to share.

122
00:06:13.04 --> 00:06:16.00
If you want to make the AMI a public AMI

123
00:06:16.00 --> 00:06:18.00
where you allow everybody to use that

124
00:06:18.00 --> 00:06:21.05
you can use this option called public.

125
00:06:21.05 --> 00:06:23.07
I'm gonna cancel out from here,

126
00:06:23.07 --> 00:06:26.09
and back over here in the AMI
section right now you have

127
00:06:26.09 --> 00:06:29.07
a filter applied called owned by me.

128
00:06:29.07 --> 00:06:32.08
So it only shows you AMIs
that you have created.

129
00:06:32.08 --> 00:06:35.04
If you want to see private
AMIs that have been shared

130
00:06:35.04 --> 00:06:41.01
with you, you can change
that private images.

131
00:06:41.01 --> 00:06:43.08
So you can see all the
private images over here,

132
00:06:43.08 --> 00:06:46.07
and if you want to see the
public AMIs that are available

133
00:06:46.07 --> 00:06:48.06
you can do public images.

134
00:06:48.06 --> 00:06:53.06
So you can see there's 23,000
AMIs available to choose from.

135
00:06:53.06 --> 00:06:56.07
I'm gonna reset it back to owned by me.

136
00:06:56.07 --> 00:06:59.04
How about copying this
AMI to a different region?

137
00:06:59.04 --> 00:07:02.05
Let's say I want to
launch a new EC2 instance

138
00:07:02.05 --> 00:07:03.07
in a different region.

139
00:07:03.07 --> 00:07:05.09
So you could go to actions and you can say

140
00:07:05.09 --> 00:07:12.00
copy AMI and you can copy it
over to a different region.

141
00:07:12.00 --> 00:07:14.00
When you're copying
them you can also choose

142
00:07:14.00 --> 00:07:17.09
to encrypt your EBS snapshots.

143
00:07:17.09 --> 00:07:19.09
I'm gonna cancel out from here.

144
00:07:19.09 --> 00:07:22.07
Go back to instances, and now we have

145
00:07:22.07 --> 00:07:24.07
the running EC2 instance.

146
00:07:24.07 --> 00:07:26.08
Let's try to connect to that.

147
00:07:26.08 --> 00:07:28.04
So I'm gonna select this one over here

148
00:07:28.04 --> 00:07:32.05
and click on connect, and
I'm gonna say get password.

149
00:07:32.05 --> 00:07:34.08
This is something that
I wanted you to see.

150
00:07:34.08 --> 00:07:37.09
It says the password is not available.

151
00:07:37.09 --> 00:07:41.00
This instance was
launched from a custom AMI

152
00:07:41.00 --> 00:07:44.01
or the default password has changed.

153
00:07:44.01 --> 00:07:48.00
So, AWS has no idea what
the password for this

154
00:07:48.00 --> 00:07:51.07
EC2 instance is, because
the AMI was created

155
00:07:51.07 --> 00:07:55.02
from this EC2 instance
and it could be possible

156
00:07:55.02 --> 00:07:57.09
you have a custom password on that.

157
00:07:57.09 --> 00:08:00.00
This is very, very important.

158
00:08:00.00 --> 00:08:02.01
You must be aware of the password

159
00:08:02.01 --> 00:08:05.02
required to connect to that EC2 instance.

160
00:08:05.02 --> 00:08:08.03
Right now I have an
easier way to find out.

161
00:08:08.03 --> 00:08:11.09
I can use connect on my first EC2 instance

162
00:08:11.09 --> 00:08:14.06
and grab the password from there.

163
00:08:14.06 --> 00:08:15.09
Decrypt the password.

164
00:08:15.09 --> 00:08:18.03
This is my original password.

165
00:08:18.03 --> 00:08:20.09
If I had changed this
from the control panel

166
00:08:20.09 --> 00:08:23.03
of the Windows operating
system I would have

167
00:08:23.03 --> 00:08:25.04
to use the new password.

168
00:08:25.04 --> 00:08:27.09
So I'm gonna copy that,
and I'm gonna open up

169
00:08:27.09 --> 00:08:33.00
a remote desktop client.

170
00:08:33.00 --> 00:08:35.09
All right, and I'm gonna
start a new connection.

171
00:08:35.09 --> 00:08:39.06
First of all, I'm gonna
copy that password.

172
00:08:39.06 --> 00:08:46.01
Go back to the AWS console,
and copy the public IP address.

173
00:08:46.01 --> 00:08:48.08
Back over here, I'm
gonna put that IP address

174
00:08:48.08 --> 00:08:52.03
and the user name would be administrator.

175
00:08:52.03 --> 00:08:56.03
I'm gonna close that to
save that connection.

176
00:08:56.03 --> 00:08:59.03
Now, before I connect I'm
gonna terminate my session

177
00:08:59.03 --> 00:09:02.06
with this EC2 instance.

178
00:09:02.06 --> 00:09:04.07
All right, I've closed
that in the background.

179
00:09:04.07 --> 00:09:07.00
Now I'm gonna establish a session with

180
00:09:07.00 --> 00:09:12.06
the new EC2 instance called as WinServer2.

181
00:09:12.06 --> 00:09:17.02
All right, I'm gonna accept that.

182
00:09:17.02 --> 00:09:20.00
Okay, so now I have connected
to that EC2 instance

183
00:09:20.00 --> 00:09:22.03
and I want you to notice something now.

184
00:09:22.03 --> 00:09:25.05
If I go to start you'll notice that

185
00:09:25.05 --> 00:09:29.07
XAMPP is pre-installed,
because the original

186
00:09:29.07 --> 00:09:34.08
EC2 instance had XAMPP on
it, the AMI had XAMPP on it,

187
00:09:34.08 --> 00:09:37.03
and the EC2 instance
created out of that AMI

188
00:09:37.03 --> 00:09:40.03
also has XAMPP on it, which means

189
00:09:40.03 --> 00:09:43.07
I can now use the AMI as a golden image

190
00:09:43.07 --> 00:09:47.00
to create new EC2 instances.

191
00:09:47.00 --> 00:09:48.06
Isn't this fantastic?

192
00:09:48.06 --> 00:09:52.01
It makes things so much easier.

193
00:09:52.01 --> 00:09:54.04
And finally, before I end this video

194
00:09:54.04 --> 00:09:58.03
I'm gonna show you how to delete an AMI.

195
00:09:58.03 --> 00:10:00.01
I'm back at the AWS console.

196
00:10:00.01 --> 00:10:01.07
I'll go to AMIs.

197
00:10:01.07 --> 00:10:03.07
There are two steps that
need to be performed

198
00:10:03.07 --> 00:10:05.06
to delete the AMI.

199
00:10:05.06 --> 00:10:07.07
The first thing is you go to actions

200
00:10:07.07 --> 00:10:11.01
and you de-register that.

201
00:10:11.01 --> 00:10:12.01
Continue.

202
00:10:12.01 --> 00:10:13.07
So now, it has been de-registered,

203
00:10:13.07 --> 00:10:16.03
which means the AMI cannot be used

204
00:10:16.03 --> 00:10:19.07
to launch new EC2
instances, and to complete

205
00:10:19.07 --> 00:10:22.09
the deletion process you would
go to snapshots over here

206
00:10:22.09 --> 00:10:27.05
and you would delete all
snapshots off that AMI.

207
00:10:27.05 --> 00:10:29.03
Now that the snapshots are deleted,

208
00:10:29.03 --> 00:10:32.00
if you go back to AMIs you will still find

209
00:10:32.00 --> 00:10:33.08
your AMI over there.

210
00:10:33.08 --> 00:10:36.04
Now, this is something
that takes a little while.

211
00:10:36.04 --> 00:10:38.01
It can take a few minutes for

212
00:10:38.01 --> 00:10:41.06
the AMI to get removed from here.

213
00:10:41.06 --> 00:10:43.01
All right, so that's it for this video.

214
00:10:43.01 --> 00:10:44.03
I hope you enjoyed it.

215
00:10:44.03 --> 00:10:46.05
If you have any questions,
please let me know.

216
00:10:46.05 --> 00:10:48.01
I'd like to thank you for watching,

217
00:10:48.01 --> 00:10:50.05
and I'll catch you in the
next video, thank you.
