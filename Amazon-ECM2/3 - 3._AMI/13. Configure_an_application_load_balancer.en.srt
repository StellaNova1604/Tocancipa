00:00:00.03 --> 00:00:01.05
- [Instructor] Welcome back.

2
00:00:01.05 --> 00:00:04.05
In the last video, we set
up both the target groups,

3
00:00:04.05 --> 00:00:07.01
target group one for the beach servers,

4
00:00:07.01 --> 00:00:10.02
and target group two for the hill servers.

5
00:00:10.02 --> 00:00:12.06
Now, let's start creating
the load balancer.

6
00:00:12.06 --> 00:00:14.04
So we go to load balancers,

7
00:00:14.04 --> 00:00:17.01
create load balancer, and click on create

8
00:00:17.01 --> 00:00:19.04
for application load balancer.

9
00:00:19.04 --> 00:00:22.02
You can give it a name of your choice,

10
00:00:22.02 --> 00:00:24.09
I'm gonna call it as myELB,

11
00:00:24.09 --> 00:00:27.09
and we can choose internet
facing load balancer

12
00:00:27.09 --> 00:00:30.01
or an internal load balancer,

13
00:00:30.01 --> 00:00:32.09
and we understood the differences
when we discussed about

14
00:00:32.09 --> 00:00:35.02
classic load balancers.

15
00:00:35.02 --> 00:00:37.09
Right now, we're gonna receive
traffic from the internet,

16
00:00:37.09 --> 00:00:41.05
so we're gonna do internet
facing load balancer.

17
00:00:41.05 --> 00:00:42.04
This is interesting.

18
00:00:42.04 --> 00:00:47.07
The IP address type can
be IPv4 or dual stack.

19
00:00:47.07 --> 00:00:52.00
If it's IPv4, it only
receives IPv4 traffic.

20
00:00:52.00 --> 00:00:53.09
If you go for dual stack,

21
00:00:53.09 --> 00:00:58.04
it receives both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.

22
00:00:58.04 --> 00:01:01.07
Right now, I only wanna have IPv4,

23
00:01:01.07 --> 00:01:04.03
and here, we can configure the listeners.

24
00:01:04.03 --> 00:01:05.08
We spoke about listeners

25
00:01:05.08 --> 00:01:08.05
during the classic load balancer topic.

26
00:01:08.05 --> 00:01:11.02
A listener is a configuration
that is looking for

27
00:01:11.02 --> 00:01:15.06
incoming requests from the
internet or from your clients.

28
00:01:15.06 --> 00:01:18.05
In this case, our clients are
gonna be accessing the servers

29
00:01:18.05 --> 00:01:23.02
on port 80, HTTP, so we'll
select the protocol as HTTP

30
00:01:23.02 --> 00:01:26.04
and the port number as port 80.

31
00:01:26.04 --> 00:01:29.00
Next, we need to select
the availability zones

32
00:01:29.00 --> 00:01:31.04
where we want to route the traffic.

33
00:01:31.04 --> 00:01:35.09
You could select one or
you could select multiple.

34
00:01:35.09 --> 00:01:37.09
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna select

35
00:01:37.09 --> 00:01:39.09
multiple availability zones.

36
00:01:39.09 --> 00:01:43.02
Notice you also have the
option to choose the VPC.

37
00:01:43.02 --> 00:01:46.08
In my case, I only have one VPC.

38
00:01:46.08 --> 00:01:49.04
Having done that, let's
move onto the next step.

39
00:01:49.04 --> 00:01:51.05
Meanwhile, you can also
add some tags over here

40
00:01:51.05 --> 00:01:53.08
for identification purposes.

41
00:01:53.08 --> 00:01:57.02
I'm gonna say next
configure security settings.

42
00:01:57.02 --> 00:02:00.02
Over here, we would not
be configuring anything

43
00:02:00.02 --> 00:02:04.06
because we have selected HTTP
as the listener configuration.

44
00:02:04.06 --> 00:02:08.09
If you go for HTTPS, then we'll
have to configure this part.

45
00:02:08.09 --> 00:02:13.04
Moving on, we can configure
the security groups.

46
00:02:13.04 --> 00:02:15.05
I'm gonna select an
existing security group,

47
00:02:15.05 --> 00:02:18.04
which is HTTP for myELB,

48
00:02:18.04 --> 00:02:22.02
which basically allows port 80 inbound.

49
00:02:22.02 --> 00:02:24.07
Click on next, configure routing.

50
00:02:24.07 --> 00:02:27.07
On step number four, we
need to configure routing,

51
00:02:27.07 --> 00:02:29.01
and as you can see over here,

52
00:02:29.01 --> 00:02:31.08
we need to provide a target group.

53
00:02:31.08 --> 00:02:35.06
The good part is that we
already have one ready.

54
00:02:35.06 --> 00:02:37.06
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna select

55
00:02:37.06 --> 00:02:39.05
an existing target group,

56
00:02:39.05 --> 00:02:42.05
and you can select any one of them,

57
00:02:42.05 --> 00:02:44.07
TG1 or TG2.

58
00:02:44.07 --> 00:02:48.02
What I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go with TG1.

59
00:02:48.02 --> 00:02:51.08
The protocol is selected
as HTTP and the port is 80,

60
00:02:51.08 --> 00:02:53.07
and the target type is instance,

61
00:02:53.07 --> 00:02:56.02
and you'll notice we
cannot select anything

62
00:02:56.02 --> 00:03:00.01
because it's all pre-configured in TG1.

63
00:03:00.01 --> 00:03:02.03
Also notice that the health check protocol

64
00:03:02.03 --> 00:03:06.00
is configured over here, and
the path is also configured.

65
00:03:06.00 --> 00:03:09.07
Again, all this comes
from TG1 configuration.

66
00:03:09.07 --> 00:03:12.05
Down over here, you'll notice
everything is pre-configured,

67
00:03:12.05 --> 00:03:16.02
nothing is editable because
it's all configured over here.

68
00:03:16.02 --> 00:03:17.05
Why do they have it?

69
00:03:17.05 --> 00:03:20.04
Well, if you were configuring
a new target group,

70
00:03:20.04 --> 00:03:23.03
then you would be
configuring all these items.

71
00:03:23.03 --> 00:03:26.09
Right now, it's all pre-configured,
so we can skip this,

72
00:03:26.09 --> 00:03:29.07
and we can go to next, register targets.

73
00:03:29.07 --> 00:03:32.03
You'll notice that the
targets are also selected,

74
00:03:32.03 --> 00:03:34.07
because this target has been registered

75
00:03:34.07 --> 00:03:38.00
in the target group, right?

76
00:03:38.00 --> 00:03:39.02
Click on next review.

77
00:03:39.02 --> 00:03:42.02
We can review all the settings
that we've made so far,

78
00:03:42.02 --> 00:03:45.03
and we can click on create.

79
00:03:45.03 --> 00:03:47.03
Now, we're ready.

80
00:03:47.03 --> 00:03:49.05
So you can see over here,

81
00:03:49.05 --> 00:03:52.01
we have a DNS name for the load balancer,

82
00:03:52.01 --> 00:03:55.07
it's internet facing, it's
an application load balancer,

83
00:03:55.07 --> 00:03:59.03
it's forwarding traffic to
both the availability zones,

84
00:03:59.03 --> 00:04:02.05
and the IP address type is IPv4,

85
00:04:02.05 --> 00:04:04.08
and it is currently being provisioned.

86
00:04:04.08 --> 00:04:07.01
Let's try to do a refresh.

87
00:04:07.01 --> 00:04:09.05
If we went over here to listeners,

88
00:04:09.05 --> 00:04:13.05
we can see we have a listener
configuration over here.

89
00:04:13.05 --> 00:04:18.02
Now, we can try and access
this page over here,

90
00:04:18.02 --> 00:04:21.06
and open a new page, hit enter,

91
00:04:21.06 --> 00:04:23.07
and it says the site cannot be reached,

92
00:04:23.07 --> 00:04:25.09
and that's because it's
still being provisioned.

93
00:04:25.09 --> 00:04:28.06
We can see over here, it's
still being provisioned.

94
00:04:28.06 --> 00:04:31.05
So we can wait for a little while.

95
00:04:31.05 --> 00:04:33.09
Meanwhile, we can go back
to the target groups,

96
00:04:33.09 --> 00:04:36.06
and let's check what's the status of TG1.

97
00:04:36.06 --> 00:04:39.05
We can select TG1 and
we can go to targets,

98
00:04:39.05 --> 00:04:42.06
and you'll notice over
here it says initial,

99
00:04:42.06 --> 00:04:44.09
target registration is in progress.

100
00:04:44.09 --> 00:04:48.01
So, we need to wait until
this becomes healthy,

101
00:04:48.01 --> 00:04:50.03
and that should happen pretty soon.

102
00:04:50.03 --> 00:04:53.06
Let's do a refresh.

103
00:04:53.06 --> 00:04:56.00
Alright, so now, it's in a healthy state,

104
00:04:56.00 --> 00:04:58.05
which means if we go back over here,

105
00:04:58.05 --> 00:05:03.06
and if we did a refresh,
we can see the IIS page.

106
00:05:03.06 --> 00:05:05.08
Which server is this coming from?

107
00:05:05.08 --> 00:05:09.02
It is coming from the
server in AP south one A,

108
00:05:09.02 --> 00:05:12.04
or server one, because
that's the target group

109
00:05:12.04 --> 00:05:15.06
that has been associated
with the load balancer.

110
00:05:15.06 --> 00:05:17.09
If you go back to load balancers,

111
00:05:17.09 --> 00:05:21.06
we can see over here, under listeners,

112
00:05:21.06 --> 00:05:23.08
that it is forwarding to TG1,

113
00:05:23.08 --> 00:05:26.08
so it is actually coming from server one.

114
00:05:26.08 --> 00:05:30.09
On server one, we know that we
have a folder called beaches,

115
00:05:30.09 --> 00:05:36.05
so if we did this, slash beaches,

116
00:05:36.05 --> 00:05:39.09
we should see that, and if
we click on any one of them,

117
00:05:39.09 --> 00:05:42.08
we have a nice, beautiful
picture of the beach.

118
00:05:42.08 --> 00:05:48.05
But what if we did slash
hills, will it work?

119
00:05:48.05 --> 00:05:50.03
It doesn't, because right now

120
00:05:50.03 --> 00:05:53.05
we are not forwarding traffic to TG2.

121
00:05:53.05 --> 00:05:55.06
That's what we're gonna configure next.

122
00:05:55.06 --> 00:05:57.05
So we'll go back over here,

123
00:05:57.05 --> 00:06:00.04
and we'll edit the load balancer,

124
00:06:00.04 --> 00:06:02.05
so I've selected the load balancer.

125
00:06:02.05 --> 00:06:05.06
Listeners, we're not
gonna add a new listener,

126
00:06:05.06 --> 00:06:08.04
we're going to change the
rules of the listener.

127
00:06:08.04 --> 00:06:10.04
So view and edit rules.

128
00:06:10.04 --> 00:06:12.05
This is where it starts
to get a little confusing

129
00:06:12.05 --> 00:06:13.09
for some people.

130
00:06:13.09 --> 00:06:15.04
View and edit rules.

131
00:06:15.04 --> 00:06:18.06
So the rule is like this,
this is the default rule.

132
00:06:18.06 --> 00:06:22.03
It says if the request,
otherwise not routed,

133
00:06:22.03 --> 00:06:25.00
which means if the request does not match

134
00:06:25.00 --> 00:06:30.00
any other routing parameter,
then forward to TG1.

135
00:06:30.00 --> 00:06:33.01
What we're gonna do is we're
gonna add one more rule,

136
00:06:33.01 --> 00:06:35.08
so I'll click on the plus icon over here,

137
00:06:35.08 --> 00:06:37.06
and I'm gonna say insert a rule,

138
00:06:37.06 --> 00:06:40.07
which will add it on top of this one,

139
00:06:40.07 --> 00:06:43.00
and we can say add condition.

140
00:06:43.00 --> 00:06:45.08
You can do a condition
based on a host header

141
00:06:45.08 --> 00:06:47.00
or a path.

142
00:06:47.00 --> 00:06:49.07
A path is the URL of that request,

143
00:06:49.07 --> 00:06:51.06
and that is what we're gonna do.

144
00:06:51.06 --> 00:06:53.09
So we'll do if the path is,

145
00:06:53.09 --> 00:06:58.00
and it contains the word /hills/.

146
00:06:58.00 --> 00:07:02.01
If the URL contains the word /hills/,

147
00:07:02.01 --> 00:07:06.06
and I'm gonna say add
action, forward it to TG2,

148
00:07:06.06 --> 00:07:09.03
because that's where the
servers for the hills

149
00:07:09.03 --> 00:07:10.06
have been configured.

150
00:07:10.06 --> 00:07:15.02
TG2, click on save, fantastic.

151
00:07:15.02 --> 00:07:19.00
We can now go back and, before
we try to access the URL,

152
00:07:19.00 --> 00:07:24.03
we can go to target groups,
select the second one, TG2,

153
00:07:24.03 --> 00:07:28.03
and you'll notice, now this
one is also an initial.

154
00:07:28.03 --> 00:07:30.04
So if we try to refresh this,

155
00:07:30.04 --> 00:07:33.01
we're still gonna get no response.

156
00:07:33.01 --> 00:07:34.07
I'm actually doing a refresh,

157
00:07:34.07 --> 00:07:36.00
you can see that over here.

158
00:07:36.00 --> 00:07:37.08
It doesn't work because

159
00:07:37.08 --> 00:07:40.01
the server is still being initialized.

160
00:07:40.01 --> 00:07:43.02
So we'll have to wait, in
fact, it's already ready,

161
00:07:43.02 --> 00:07:44.04
it's now in healthy.

162
00:07:44.04 --> 00:07:49.03
So, if we go back over
here, if we did a refresh,

163
00:07:49.03 --> 00:07:52.01
it's still not working,
and I just realized,

164
00:07:52.01 --> 00:07:54.04
the URL is not correct.

165
00:07:54.04 --> 00:07:57.00
It is correct, but I need
to add a trailing slash,

166
00:07:57.00 --> 00:08:00.01
because the listener has
been configured to add

167
00:08:00.01 --> 00:08:01.06
the trailing slash.

168
00:08:01.06 --> 00:08:04.08
So if I put a trailing slash
over here and I hit enter,

169
00:08:04.08 --> 00:08:07.09
now I can see that.

170
00:08:07.09 --> 00:08:10.05
So that's how we configure a target group.

171
00:08:10.05 --> 00:08:12.01
As you can see over here,

172
00:08:12.01 --> 00:08:14.05
based on the requests that we make,

173
00:08:14.05 --> 00:08:18.04
based on the URL or based on
the words contained in the URL,

174
00:08:18.04 --> 00:08:21.00
the traffic is being forwarded
to different servers.

175
00:08:21.00 --> 00:08:24.07
If I did slash beaches,

176
00:08:24.07 --> 00:08:26.04
you'll notice that the
traffic is being forwarded

177
00:08:26.04 --> 00:08:29.01
to a different server,
and if we did slash hills,

178
00:08:29.01 --> 00:08:30.08
like what we tried right now,

179
00:08:30.08 --> 00:08:33.02
the traffic is going
to a different server.

180
00:08:33.02 --> 00:08:36.04
As we can see, this is an
intelligent load balancer.

181
00:08:36.04 --> 00:08:41.03
It has the intelligence to know
where to route the request.

182
00:08:41.03 --> 00:08:45.03
The final piece of the
puzzle is the index.html.

183
00:08:45.03 --> 00:08:47.06
We're gonna put a file called index.html

184
00:08:47.06 --> 00:08:49.06
on both the servers,

185
00:08:49.06 --> 00:08:52.08
and we want to have a
round robin load balancing

186
00:08:52.08 --> 00:08:57.01
when somebody tries to access index.html.

187
00:08:57.01 --> 00:08:59.06
In the next video, we'll
see how to do that.

188
00:08:59.06 --> 00:09:01.05
I'd like to thank you for watching,

189
00:09:01.05 --> 00:09:03.03
and I'll catch you in the next video.

190
00:09:03.03 --> 00:09:04.01
Thank you.
